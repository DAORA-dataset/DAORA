Awesome !
Really liked the reviews of this hotel and delighted to see that they actually take the time to respond to some of the comments people make !
Shows they take pride in what they do ! !
So we booked it and very pleased we did .
Staff were very friendly and very helpful .
Location was fabulous and the hotel amenities were brilliant .
Particularly like the on - tap tea and coffee available in the lobby all day - lovely to come back to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon !
The bedroom was very clean and tidy .
I have to say , I was really worried about the fact I 'd neglected to ask for a quiet room and we were then given a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the street .
However , I need n't have worried because once the windows were closed , you could hardly hear a thing except for the ding ding of the cable cars - great double glazing ! !
No problem with there only being a ceiling fan instead of AC either ( I find AC units are difficult to regular and just end up making me ill ) .
Overally , great location , great service , great value for money .
Definitely would stay here again ! !
Great place .
Before going I had read all the reviews posted on the site and I am glad everything they say is true .
It is definitely worth staying at the Chancellor .
Everyone is really helpful and nice .
I tried several SF hotels and this is the only one I 'll go back to .
You can do a lot better in San Francisco .
If you want to impress your cab driver - go with the St . Francis Francis Francis .
If you need to be directly across the street from Union Square and ca n't walk even one block ( and why you would go to SF if that were the case ) - go with the St . Francis .
If you want to pay more than other hotels - go with the St . Francis .
Ths St . Francis is old , large and used to be quite grand .
It is now a bit tired .
However , the staff do n't know that .
The concierge is excellent - truly first class .
The bell staff are fair .
The hotel frequently endures labor protests .
When that happens the bell staff are posted as a security barrier and become somewhat useless for the usual purposes .
The front desk staff are not too helpful .
I 've stayed there before ( hey I think picketers shouting Hotel clients should be aware - St . Francis is unfair is fun to watch ) .
Here is the problem .
You are right on the trolley line but several blocks from the BART station .
You can book whatever room you want and confirm it all you like but you will get what they have .
For example , book a king room .
Go ahead and confirm that you have a king room .
Then arrive and find you are in a double bed not a king .
Explain to the front desk that you reserved a king .
They will agree that you did .
They will confirm that you are in a double .
They will then tell you that rooms are subject to availability .
They will take your name and number ( and usually your cell number ) and they will promise to look into it and see what they can do .
Do n't hold your breath .
In a survey of 7 or 8 folks who had the same issue none received any follow - up .
That 's the problem with the St . Francis . .
They do n't care because they do n't have to care .
That hotel will be full no matter what they do .
Do yourself a favor - there are at least 10 hotels within 2 blocks of Union Square .
Save money , aggravation etc etc and stay somewhere that is hungry for your business .
SF is a great city - why bother with arrogance .
Standard motel in beautiful San Francisco .
A comfortable bed
An average Renaissance .
The large 1980s marble lobby is probably the nicest part of this hotel .
The 4 star rating should be 3 . 5 .
The room was large and clean with an ok bath ( not luxurious by any means ) .
We had a high floor so no city noise .
Corridors are bright and newly carpeted .
Our dealings with the hotel staff were minimal , so I can not fairly comment on the service .
Superb location near the Powell Street Cable Car , Nordstrom ( and 2005 the new Bloomingdale ' s ) , Abercrombie , Gap , and two blocks away from Union Square with almost every luxury retailer you could want .
BART within 30 yards and one block away is the Market Street trolly .
However , San Francisco is loaded with beggers , panhandlers and homeless people .
Interestingly , NONE of them are of Asain descent . . . ponder that .
They seem to congregate near the subway area ( big shock ! ) but are not aggressive .
Not a plethora of restaurants near the hotel , and the doorman did advise ( read : warn ) us not to venture onto the streets toward the rear of the hotel .
We took his advice and had a great safe trip .
Fisherman 's Wharf is little but T - shirt shops and mediocre tourist restaurants .
Do n't miss the cable car . . . even if there is a long line .
One other item : The bus tours to the wine country are little more than sales pitches at the wineries to get you to buy their wines ; highlight of that tour was 2 hours in the town of Sonoma .
We Do n't Need No Water Pressure .
I was upgraded to the 32nd floor as the hotel was full despite booking my room several months in advance .
Whilst I had a room when I arrived , they had messed up the booking even though I called from abroad to confirm my arrival .
First note to self - this is a bad sign of mis - management .
I was cheerfully checked in and then went to my room on the Club floor .
I expected to have a magnificent rooom only to be disappointed by at best a decidedly average room .
Not more room , but some tasky nicer appointments .
The bed was pretty decent , but the distinct lack of water pressure , without scalding yourself or freezing cold shower does not justify the Club experience in my humble opinion .
If you stay here you also get to deal with the hordes of tramps frequently around the outside of the hotel at night ddue to proximity to the Tenderloin district , so take cabs at night .
Frankly I would probably not pay my personal money to stay here - - the company paid .
Iffy ... .
Well , I am not sure if I really liked or did not like this hotel .
There were good things and bad things . .
Good Location is great !
We were close to so many great things and the trolley stop in right out front .
Staff - they were nice .
Bathrooms were very clean !
Bad - Paper thin walls . I heard everything my neighbor said . It was awful .
Bed - hard as rock .
I actually woke up with a backache .
Overall impression of the hotel could be better .
The rooms are very very tiny and they def need to redo the hotel .
The decorations , carpet and bedspreads are old and shabby .
Carpet looks dirty .
If you are sharing a room with someone you do not know , get TWO rooms .
I felt like I was back in college in my dorm room . . .
Ask for a room in the back of the hotel or high up .
You can hear everything on the street . . .
If you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive , close to the sights and just want to drop your stuff off and go - this is the place .
Just bring earpplugs and expect to feel very close to the person you are sharing a room with .
Basic Accomodations With No Frills .
We stayed at the Castle Inn in June 2008 .
The location is convenient to tourist attractions and public transportation .
Our room was clean but a bit rundown .
Do n't count on the breakfast that is included ; instant coffee and packaged muffins , etc .
Better to go down the street to one of the local bagel shops or coffee shops .
The lady at the front desk needs some sensitivity training .
We observed her being just plain rude to some of the other guests .
Overall , you get what you pay for .
A low - cost place to sleep with no frills .
Nothing Special !
I reserved an upgraded double room in the tower upper floors .
Upon check - in I was informed I 'd been given a single room .
Since I was traveling with two children this would n't work !
I was then given a double on a lower floor with somewhat of a view .
The carpets were stained , the drapes pulled loose at the top and the bathroom door completely missing a handle .
The beds were great though !
The lobby is beautiful but the rooms are mediocre at best .
They have a children 's welcome gift upon check - in but were out of older kids bags so we were given the toddler gifts that consisted of electrical outlet plug covers , a night light and a rubber duck .
Not much use to a 9 and 10 year old !
The location is great and the cable car stops right in front !
Centrally located hotel with heritage .
It 's a typical city hotel with 4 - stars .
the rooms must have been renovated recently .
they all are quite spacious , have a marble bathroom , new furniture , the usual expensive internet access and a brand new entertainment system ( about 100 high - definition on - demand movies to choose from ) .
The food is not spectacular there are better value - price offerings in walking distance around the hotel .
Their premium restaurant Michael Mina ( named after the chef ) supposed to be better , but according to the menue also in the upper price level .
The hotel is located centrally right next to the union square right in the shopping district ( Macy ' s , Nieman Marcus and a few more shopping malls and shopping streets are in walking distance ) .
Also in walking distance is China Town and Fishermen 's warf .
Rates are 195 USD per kingsize double ; this is the usual price range for a hotel of this class ( all the others known chains were more expensive ) .
Nightmare experience .
We had a reservation that we booked online directly through the property .
When we got there to check in they said they had been trying to contact us ( which I know they hadn ' t ) because they did not have a room for us .
When I asked how they lost our reservation , she said they did not lose it but rather they never had a room for us when they received our reservation they had handed it over to their management dept . to handle , who never once tried to contact us .
Funny how we got a confirmation via email but we did not receive the email they supposedly sent to tell us of the situation , nor did we receive any phone calls they claimed to have made .
They offered to upgrade us at another sister property so we said ok .
They drove us to new property which was further away from where we wanted to be looked like a dive .
When we walked into the office , the man behind the desk did not even look up or speak to us for a couple minutes .
He finally said the room was not ready we could wait next door .
This was supposed to be a smoke - free hotel but the manager was in his room ( right off the registration area ) smoking away in his unmade bed .
The complimentary continental breakfast consisted of powered orange juice , coffee , tea , hot cocoa , danishes that had been sitting out in the smoky office .
Needless to say , we did not stay here found accomodations elsewhere in the city .
Bottom line - - poor management customer service .
I would not stay here if it was the last place in San Francisco .
The St . Francis just does n't care We stayed for one night .
The room was fine for the price ( Hotwire $ 65 ) .
We had a small bottle of wine from the mini - bar for $ 18 . It was not bad .
When we checked out , I told the desk clerk about the wine and paid $ 18 .
When we got home , two $ 18 charges were on our credit card bill .
I called the St . Francis on a Saturday to get their mistake corrected .
The desk clerk said there was nothing he could do and said I would have to talk to accounting between 9 - 5 during the week .
He did n't offer to take a message and somehow seemed to suggest that this whole thing was my fault .
It 's funny how the hotel is able to charge your card 24 - 7 , but when they take your money without cause , suddenly it 's very difficult for them to give it back .
Very poor attitude and service .
OK but maybe needs a few tweaks !
This hotel is huge ! !
But one of the worse things about it - the elevator . It goes so fast that it actually makes you feel sick and not only that , you can wait 10 mins or so for one to come and they are pretty small .
We had 2 rooms and could n't get one near to each other - one was on the 3rd floor but the other on the 8th and then they asked to move our 8th floor room because of carpetting work .
They moved us to a smaller room which stunk of cigarettes ! !
The staff were n't particuarly friendly .
Although I had an amazing pedicure in the spa .
The location is ok - beware of homeless people all outside though .
The decor is nice , although there seems to be a few things that need updating , paint pealing etc .
Would have been nice to have A / C too .
Overpriced breakfast .
But I have to say the beds were amazing , so comfortable .
It felt like heaven !
Castle Inn - Great Location .
We stopped here for 4 nights .
I booked directly with the Inn and they were easy to deal with .
They responded quickly to all my email queries and were very helpful .
On arrival I was a bit put out , as the rooms looked a bit dark and shabby .
The continental breakfast was limited , and some rooms will suffer from traffic noise .
However , the maid service was very good and the location was spot on .
It was easily walkable to Fishermans Wharf and the buses and cable cars were just a few minutes walk away .
There were also plenty of places to eat and some small shops just minutes away .
Getting to any where from here was easy .
The front desk staff also let us know the places to go and where not to venture and they also gave us maps and a great list of buses to use to get to see all the sights .
Overall , the Inn was good value for money , location was excellent and we enjoyed our stay .
Good place for locals and out of town folks .
Okay . . . . you live in the area and want to do something different . . . . . hmmmmmm . . . . Napap Valley ? Sonoma ? The coast .
Why not pop on to BART and spend a night in the City !
It was my anniversary so my partner and I thought , why not .
We enjoyed the experience .
Okay , okay . . . qualify the stars . I would give it a 3 3 / 4 if possible .
As opposed to some of the reviewers , we asked for a tower room rather than a room in the older part of the establishment .
Linens , pillows and mattress ( as well as the view of the city and bay from the windows of our tower room ) FIVE STARS .
The linens and bed were VERY nice .
I travel a fair amount for work and this was genuinely one of the nicest beds I 've had the pleasure to sleep in in a long time !
The condition of the room left a bit to be desired .
There was duct tape around one of the widows and the carpet was slightly damp .
As we opened the curtains when we first entered the room , one of plastic pullbacks for the drapes was on the floor .
Some of the wall covering was peeling off of the wall by the windows as well .
Yes , I understand this is a big and busy hotel but when I spend the kind of $ $ $ it would have been nice not to have damp carpet .
The lobby is beautiful and location convenient to shopping and downtown .
To my fellow bay areaians . . . . . . looking for a fun night in the City ?
Give the St . Francis a try .
When inexpensive means tacky .
If you can climb the streets of San Francisco and then spend the evening with no way to even heat water for tea , much less have coffee , then be the Chancellor 's guest .
I requested a microwave , and the dead - pan answer was that they had coffee and hot water 24 hours a day in the lobby .
Not good .
And the notes from others about no climate control should be taken seriously .
Chancellor will respond that the windows can be opened .
My window jammed when I locked it to get some safety from the antiquated fire escape , and I called immediately for someone to come and free the lock .
When I check out the next morning , the lock was still jammed .
Staff attitudes are questionable : chambermaids friendly enough .
Desk staff , bartender , appear as if trained to avoid eye contact , and not even return smiles , much less originate them .
not as friendly as these posts elude .
Because of all the positive comments we had read here , we were n't too worried about our stay .
Unfortunately , we were not very pleased .
The place seemed a little run down and the staff was not friendly at all .
The woman at the front desk did n't even greet us with a hello to us when we came into the front office . . .
something you would expect if everyone proclaims they are friendly .
In addition , when we met up with our friends and they helped us unload our luggage , the lady from the front desk ran out and confronted us about having extra people .
We explained that they were our friends FROM SF there to show us around . . . only helping us carry our luggage .
When we checked out the next day she yelled from the front office window at us , while we are on the street . . . . that she was charging us for extra people . . . . and they did !
However , only 2 of us stayed at the hotel ! !
So much for friendly staff !
We 've stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area .
Those were similarly priced , friendlier , and a better quality room for the money .
I would avoid this place and would not go hear again .
Fading Jewel .
This USE to be a wonderful jewel .
What is lacking is a long list !
Did they forget how to train their staff on cleanliness of bathrooms ?
Can they have someone touch up all the scratches on the furniture in the room ?
When is the last time the carpet was even vacuumed ?
We were hungry at 10am , went to the lobby cafe and they were completely sold out of pastries so the staff directed us to the Oak Room .
Stood there for 5 minutes and a bus boy , yelled across the room ( with people eating there ) we 're closed . . . come back for lunch .
What the heck is wrong with their customer service ?
I think this is Starwood right ?
They should have enough money to spend on improving the overall experience here I would hope . . . of all hotels , this landmark needs better attention a better reputation ! ! ! !
Listen up managment . . . you need to get more particular - and get your people trained !
Over priced parking .
My husband and I stayed here for our wedding night , and at first they put us in a tower room .
We called down disappointed because the room was very business like and cold .
They put us in the historic portion of the hotel , which was much prettier and had the charm we were looking for .
It still did n't have the big bathtub that the lady on the phone boasted about as fitting more than 2 people in - LOL it was nothing but a standard tub .
The next day when we went to check out , we were charged a whopping $ 63.00 for parking ONE NIGHT in their structure .
This included an extra $ 7.50 charge for having an over sized vehicle ( Ford F250 with 4 inch lift ) I was infuriated at the blatant highway robbery !
When the valet drove it up , he stood there like one of the homeless people ( which are swarming that area anyway ) with his hand out until we gave him a buck . . . so make that $ 64.00 for parking ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Do n't stay here - they charge $ 75 if you depart a day early on mult - night stay .
I was told that they required 24 hours to change dates of stay or cancel .
I checked in and had planned on staying three nights .
After the first night , I found out that I would be leaving one day early and told them - - more than 24 hours in advance - - that I would be leaving one day early .
I was charged a $ 75 early departure fee .
I will never stay here again and recommend you do not either .
Bring your earplugs !
noisy , noisy , noisy !
small rooms where you hear all of what 's going on in neighboring rooms and the hallway , never again !
Some problems .
I was excited to stay at the Chancellor Hotel after reading all the reviews .
This hotel was certainly a bargain .
We were able to get it pretty cheap from Priceline .
I always wonder if we get our hotel from such a website , does that indicate we will get a bad room ?
We were on the top floor with no view .
We saw the backs of builiding and ugly rooftops .
Because we would be out of the hotel 90 % of the time , I did n't mind .
The front desk staff was very nice .
The door man helped us with our bags and was very courteous .
The hotel does n't need A / C . It was freezing in the middle of July and the fan does a fine job cooling you down .
With the windows open , however , you do hear garbage trucks and a lot of noise from the city ( trolleys gear up around 6 or 7 am ) .
We stopped downstairs to try to figure out how to get a trolley pass and we quickly found the reservation desk .
The woman behind the reservation desk was unreal . I have never experienced such behavior . She was taking a personal call while we were standing in front of her .
She actually put her hand over the phone and asked us what we needed , gave us a short answer and then went back to talking on the phone . It was something you would see in a sitcom .
My husband got out money for a trolley pass and he stood there with the money out for over a minute while we listened to her telephone conversation .
So , we did n't get the great treatment that it appears other reviewers received .
The trolleys were always full and after buying a 3 - day pass to use them , we were very upset that we ended up walking the majority of the time .
We found out later that if we would have walked 2 blocks we would be picked up without a problem ( this is something the reservation desk should have told us )
Parking is around $ 30 . 00 plus tax a day , which is another expenditure you will need to budget in .
We also had a problem with someone trying to get into our room around midnight on our second night .
I was happy to be checking out the next day and moving onto Napa Valley where it was quieter , where you do n't need to pay for parking and everyone was very accomidating .
location great , but not a destination hotel .
We booked the Chancellor based on the rave reviews on this site ; we were similarly enthralled by the location , but not terribly excited by anything else .
The plumbing was loud , the room was tiny , the window opened onto a metal maze of a fire escape , the umbrella broke as soon as we opened it , and the lobby bar was the least appealing place in the city .
Stay here if you want a central location and do n't plan to spend much time in the room , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
Good location , enjoyed our stay at Orchard .
My wife and I recently spent three night at the Orchard Hotel .
We chose the hotel because of its proximity to Union Square .
Our room was of decent size , nicely furnished and clean .
The hotel 's staff was courtesy and friendly .
The prices in the hotel 's restaurant and bar were on the high side but with a number of restaurants in the area , this was not a problem .
The one negative was noise from the room next door ; the rooms had a connecting door that - I think - allowed voices and other sounds to be heard between the rooms .
While this provided for a couple of annoying moments , we did n't lose any sleep or feel the need to complain .
Overall , we were pleased with our stay at the Orchard Hotel and would stay there again .
Great place to stay at the Union Square .
We stayed at the Chancellor hotel at the Union Square from 21st to the 29th of Aug , for a conference at the Grand Hyatt and we really enjoyed it .
Check in : Easy and a friendly .
We had requested a refrigerator in the room ( based on one of the TA reviews - it really was very useful ) Room : Really comfortable for two people .
The walk - in closet really expanded the space so that you could store your suitcases and not bump into anything .
We had asked for the topmost floor overlooking the Union square , based on TA reviews and were glad for the choice .
We were n't bothered by traffic or noise , and in fact found the music filtering in every evening from the Union square really charming .
The sound of the cable cars and fire engines was n't bad enough to disturb our sleep .
Bathroom : Slightly on the smaller size , but big enough when we used it one at a time .
Wished we had used the comfortable bath - tub ( and the rubber duck ) .
Lobby : The hotel lobby is intimate and cosy enough that you welcome coming back after a cool and tiring day .
The freshly baked cookies with different types baked everyday ( chocolate chip , raisin etc ) , coffee and apples were appreciated .
Infact after the first day , when we had Starbucks , we did n't really feel the need to have any coffee elsewhere . ( I usually obsess over my coffee , and I really liked it ) .
Location : ( I hate saying location , location , location , location ) Great .
Just right next to Union square , a hop across to cafes , diners , small bistros , delis , a cable car stop right across , and very convenient for our conference also - just a block across .
Staff : Rory , Steve , and the other guys at the reception - very helpful .
Any question we had , use of the business center to print our boarding cards , picking up a Fedex for us and calling us up when it came - very helpful .
LuquesFilling breakfast with cheerful staff ( especially Nancy ) .
We had breakfast a day before the conference and it was really good .
Bacon usually is too salty to eat , but even an occasional non - vegetarian like me enjoyed it .
My wife had the veggie menu and felt her breakfast was ok .
Smell : I know somebody had mentioned some smell in the lobby .
I did n't really notice any smell except the nice smell of popcorn .
There was however some funny smell in the passage outside our room .
Just a minor point , and not really a big issue , as the room was comfortable , ( non smelly ) and the location cant be beaten .
Would we come back here - Yes ! in a heartbeat . .
Just loved San Francisco , and the convenience and homely feel of the Chancellor had a lot to do with it .
Best Rate Guarenteed . . . I do n't think so !
After much procrasternating , I finally decided to stay at the Argonaut .
Alpharooms . com was showing a fully inclusive price of $ 715 . 01 for the four nights in November . . .
Pretty good I thought !
I always prefer to book with the hotel directly if I can so I contacted Kimpton Hotels and asked them to honour their web site promise of a price match .
Karen mentioned some nonsense of not having the right type of room and then just said that they do not honour fully inclusive rates which goes directly against their web site promise .
Having spent over 30 minutes on the phone from London , England , I now feel that Kimpton Hotels have been just plain dishonest about wanting to accommadate their propective guests .
I 'm sure it 's neither legal nor in fact good business practice to make offers you simply renage upon , therefore , I will not be staying at the Argonaut in San Francisco but , I will be complaining further .
I 'm involved within the customer services industry in the UK where this would simply not be tolerated .
A very sorry tale which leaves a bad taste for this traveller !
I wish you better luck !
Great location , awful service .
This hotel is in a great location , close to Fishermans Wharf and the cable car stop .
I had read the reviews prior to going and booked , as I thought , a room with a bay view through my travel agent in England . ( Six months prior to travel )
I contacted the hotel prior to leaving the UK to make sure we had a twin room .
Got a reply saying they had done a free upgrade from an interior room .
Emailed back to say I had ordered room with a bay view , then hotel decided I only had a room with a view - this is a view of the cannery but they would upgrade me , no charge .
Be aware when booking that you ask for precisely the room and view wanted Arrived after nearly 24 hours travelling to be given wrong room .
They then disputed my upgrade - I had printed the email .
Eventually got the room we wanted a day later but by then our view of the hotel service was very wary .
New room had non working TV and overlooked building works .
Nice hotel but I wo n't stay there again as we had better service on previous visits to the Hyatt and nearly same location .
Grand Hotel , Great Location .
My hubby and I stayed at this property for 6 days over new year of 2006 .
This is a great property in SF , best location of all , we think .
We were warned that parking in SF is very expensive ( $ 40 / day ) , we do n't want to waste money on parking at all .
So without a rental , this property is the one .
You can take the bart train from Airport to the Bart station at Pawell st , which is located just accross the street from the hotel .
And if you do want to get out of town to check out other sites , you can easily rent a car for the day , which is very convinient .
In town , the powell st cable cart is just around the corner .
We got a room on the higher flr , so the noise level could be lower , and plus you get nice city view . . . .
they do have in - room high speed internet , but cost extral , I ordered it for a week , around $ 40 , I think , which is worth it , since it is very good for finding out the stuff you want to do , restrauants you want to eat at , e . t . c . . . .
Over all , we are very happy with it .
This will be our spot for SF from now on . . .
The reviews are correct , an excellent place to stay .
The Nob Hill Motor Inn , just fantastic .
If your going to San Francisco just stay there .
Possibly the best value hotel in the world , free parking in San Francisco only two blocks from a cable car .
This sort of hotel is rare .
Great Location .
We stayed at the Tuscan Inn for 3 nights in April .
It is in a great location , the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus .
There was a problem though that the hotel did not receive our request for a twin room and we ended up in a double for the first night .
Despite 3 requests and 3 promises for a rollaway bed , it never arrived .
The night front desk personnel were disinterested and could not be bothered , although the day personnel were lovely and sorted another room for us .
If you plan to be out and about most of the time you are in SF , I 'd definately recommend the hotel .
But if you want to relax in the hotel , then you 'd be better choosing somewhere else .
By the way , the hotel 's restaurant is great .
The food is lovely and the staff very friendly .
Chancellor was A - PLUS ! ! ! !
I stayed at the Chancellor during June 8 - 15 , the staff was very helpful , the location was wonderful , the room was Very Nice , and overall I was very Impressed .
The room was very nicely decorated , very quite .
The only negative was the size of the bathroom was small but with amenties like the Pillow menu , the cookies and the coffee / tea there is really nothing I can find fault with .
Mr Tyler was also very Helpful in all of my requests and I will defintely be back !
I left my heart in San Francisco . . . . .
What a letdown ! - Renaissance Parc 55 San Francisco After reading other reviews we had expected better from this hotel .
Room decors are boring , to say the least , and furnishings are much like those you would find in a highway motel .
It is located next to a rough part of town .
Parking was expensive at $ 35 per night ( 2003 ) .
Next time we will look for better value .
This hotel just does n't cut it !
Nice rooms and public area , very poor service .
This was my third time at the hotel .
The first time I was put in the old building , and our room was terrible .
The second time they comped my stay - - had a great room overlooking Union Square in the new tower .
This third time I booked 3 rooms .
As an SPG gold member , I usually get upgrades .
But the women who checked us in , would not even give us the king room we booked .
My wife insisted on talking with the manager and we finally got our king room ( but no upgrade ) .
The room was in the old building , but it was recently renovated .
The rooms was well furnished and appointed .
But the service at the hotel is terrible .
In addition to the check - in fiasco , we could n't find a bellperson .
They have one doorman for a 600 + room hotel .
We ended up carrying our own luggage ( including stroller ) inside .
Upon coming and going to the hotel , the doorman ( even when he was not busy ) never offered to help us lift our stroller over the steps of the hotel 's front entrance .
We asked the conceirge to recommend a good place for sushi .
After a 5 minute wait , he came back with some places .
We asked what he particuarly liked about them , and he said he just searched on Google for sushi .
We ended up finding something ourselves since we know the area pretty well .
So if you need a nice room in a good location , the St . Francis will fit the bill .
But after staying in many SF hotels ( we used to live in the city ) , we prefer the Omni , which has amazing service .
Other good options are the Grand Hyatt and Marriott , both of which have better service than the St . Francis .
Not bad , not bad . . .
Stayed at the Castle Inn the night of March 7th , 05 .
Chose it based on the many reviews it has received on this site .
Needed a place to crash after the Dear Friends : Music from Final Fantasy concert .
Nice little motel , quite good for the money .
I 'm not too picky about things , so the Castle Inn pleased me .
Pros : - Queen Bed - TV - A / C - Microwave - Mini Fridge - Very clean room - Shower was very clean , water temp was perfect , shower head had good pressure . - Iron and Ironing Board ( Girlfriend loved that ) - Free Parking ( everywhere else charged $ 25 extra !
The parking garage is quite small , I sort of had a hard time maneuvering my little hatchback around in it . ) -
Less than a block from Walgreens ! -
Lady at front desk helping with directions ( even though she was off by a couple blocks on the destination . No big deal . Nice of her to help ! ) - Low Price ! ( about $ 75 ! )
Cons : - Pillows and bed were hard .
I wasnt bothered by it too much , but my girlfriend is picky about what she sleeps on . -
Only got two matchbook size bars of soap and two small lipstick size tubes of shampoo for two people to shower and wash with . -
TV remote didnt work . No biggie . - Too few towels . Towels were sort of rough . -
All the fruit was gone from the Continental Breakfast - Could hear neighboring rooms ' toilets flushing during the night .
Woke me up a couple times .
I 'd definitely consider staying at the Castle Inn again , especially if the prices stay the same .
Nice room for the money !
Great Hotel .
This was a wonderful Hotel .
After reading some of the bad reviews , we started to worry about staying here .
Our worries washed away the moment we reached the hotel .
The staff was amazing , and went out of their way to help us .
The coffee and treats in the moring was amazing .
The wine and treats at night were great also , nice touch .
We took the advice from other reviewers and requested a court - yard side room . Glad we did , it was very quite .
Some say the rooms are small , but ours was n't that tiny .
A normal size hotel room compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed in , besides we did n't spend much time in the room when there is so much to do around San Francisco .
I will stay here again if I ever get the chance to go back to San Francisco .
Terrific rooms .
I travel to SF frequently and have passed this hotel without noticing it many times .
The TripAdvisor reviews we so good I decided to try it last week .
I 'm glad I did .
Thhe rooms are spacious , clean and comfortable .
My king bed was very comfortable .
The bathroom was big and bright .
Breakfast buffet was good , too .
This hotel is located on Nob Hill and is a convenient walk to the Financial District , Union Square and China Town .
The Powell St . cable car goes right by it .
Liars - Bait and Switch Operation .
The night before we were scheduled to check in at this hotel , I called to confirm our reservations .
The person at the hotel told me that Travelocity sent them a fax saying we had backed up our reservation to come in 2 nights later and that they were booked the night I was scheduled .
When I asked them to fax me a copy of this fax they refused to do so .
I then called Travelocity who called the hotel for me and came back saying that the hotel said we changed the reservation .
Total Lie !
I had never called this hotel before this moment .
Travelocity then told us they had to talk to the Managers and would call us back by 11pm Central Time .
We never received a call back , so we called again .
They got back in touch with the hotel and said we could check into their sister hotel .
Luckily I read in a previous post that this hotel was awful .
We said that was not acceptable and Travelocity said they would book us another room ( at the same rate we were scheduled to pay at another hotel ) .
So we picked another hotel that was a little more expenisive and they still charged our card the higher rate .
And took until 2 am on the phone to get another hotel ( we could have rebooked one ourselves quicker if we knew we were going to pay a higher rate ) .
My guess is the Nob Hill overbooks and takes the people who received the cheaper rates online and trys to bump them to their worse hotel .
Oh and The Travelocity Guarantee is not a guarantee .
Beware - NOT one of SF 's Top Ten Hotels !
We stayed here New Year 's Eve and the dismal journey began with the front desk completely disregarding the KING room which I had confirmed ( they acknowledged the confirmation ) and which I paid more for . . . but which they had no explanation for .
And I 'm a member of their so - called loyalty club !
They had no back - up plan for this situation and instead gave us two queen rooms .
Two separate rooms .
Not exactly an ideal situation on New Year 's Eve or anytime . Old . Musty . Dusty .
This is what comes to mind when I think about it .
The furnishings in these rooms ( since we saw two ) are six months from shabby . NOT chic .
The patterns , colors , poor lighting and such just create an un - inviting atmosphere .
The marketing photos are not a good representation of the actual rooms .
The AC situation is something else altogether .
Make sure you ask for a space heater !
The lobby is lovely but does n't make up for what 's lies upstairs .
A major overhaul is needed here .
Do Not Stay Here ! !
These People Only Care About Your Money ! ! !
Due to a delayed flight , my wife ( 5 months pregnant ) and I arrived at the Nob Hill Motor Inn after the office was closed this past Wednesday night ( 7 / 18 ) .
There was no phone number posted , just a sign reading , Office hours 7:00AM - 11:00PM so I called information and paid the $ 2 . 50 to get the local number for the motel because all we wanted to do was get to sleep .
Finally a gentleman came down to meet me and was shocked to hear that my wife and I were there to check - in to our room ( that was prepaid and for which I had a voucher that explained the room would be held for us until 7:00AM the following day ) .
He said that they already gave our room to somebody else .
As you can imagine , I was less than satisfied .
He explained to me the reason for his mismanagement ( i . e . , not holding a prepaid room for a guest who had not canceled ) on this particular occasion was because the motel did n't actually get paid yet and typically does not get paid from brokerages such as those with whom Otel . com contracts until after the guest checks out .
While I can understand his business purpose for not holding our room , I still do n't understand why the customer ( who already paid for the room ) is the one left out in the cold - literally . . . and in this case at 1:30 in the morning with a 5 month pregnant wife in tow .
Please , for our sake , do not stay at this motel .
And if you do , please convince them to change their policy / arrangement with their suppliers .
Keep In Mind .
As others , I did see the positive reviews for the Castle Inn .
I thought I 'd give it a try , booking it through Orbitz , based on the Orbitz three - star rating it had at the time .
I would just like people to have realistic expectations of this property .
This is a two - star motel , not a three - star hotel ( like the Holiday Inn at Fisherman 's Wharf ) .
It has exterior corridors .
The room was spacious and clean , but the room I was assigned smelt of cleaner , and it definitely had a motel - type feel to it .
Free parking is a big deal in San Francisco .
However , the motel 's parking is cramped , and I would n't advise parking a SUV there ( at least not for the faint of heart ) .
The staff was extremely nice , so I feel bad not writing a glowing review as so many others did here .
If you 're looking for value in a property situated in town , and you do n't mind a motel , than consider the Castle Inn .
Otherwise , I would look elsewhere .
If you look hard enough , you can get a main chain three - star hotel for just a bit more per night .
The Castle Inn was n't anything exceptional .
My main problem with the property was that it was billed as something more than it was - - a motel .
Great Location .
Great location - right in Union square .
Reasonable pricing .
Staff was helpful .
MUST DO - - - eat @ Tommaso 's in North Beach for good Italian
Great experience .
Lobby Clock St . Francis
Fabulous Hotel ! !
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco May 27 - 31st .
We had a wonderful stay and I could not recommend this hotel more highly !
The room was beautiful and spacious and extermely clean .
I have never stayed in hotel room more spotless than this one .
Even our spare toilet paper roll was wrapped in pink ribbon ! !
The doormen were always at the ready to open the door or help if you had any questions .
The service here is impeccable .
We had a problem with our toilet one night and the service person arrived in less than 5 minutes and had it fixed immediately .
The location of this hotel is perfect .
It 's away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman 's wharf and the seedier Union Square .
We rented a car and were glad we did as the lines for the cable cars were extremely long - being a holiday weekend .
To avoid paying for parking , if you are there on a weekend and have the patience to find a spot , you can park overnight on the street if your meter is n't chargeable on weekends .
Otherwise , if you park one block up at the St Mary 's garage , it 's about $ 20.00 - - - which beats the $ 50 you have to pay to park at the hotel .
I recommend this property to anyone who is going to San Francisco .
EXCELLENT hotel and will absolutely stay here again ! !
would not recommend it .
I am not a hotel snob - I do n't mind a little noise , a little bit of dirt , etc . ,
but given the fairly strong review for this place , I was very disappointed .
First , from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .
Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough - decent temperature and decent water pressure .
The room was loud loud loud .
We were on the fourth floor and could literally hear conversations on the street , with our windows shut .
The ac did not seem very accurate or effective and do not book a room with a sleeper sofa .
Do n't get me going on the noise the fridge made - it sounded like a jet plane every time the motor shifted .
I finally had to buy sleeping pill across the street to try to sleep through all of this .
Then my last morning , I got to hear a heated argument between the reception desk and the police .
The police were investigating something that had happened and staff would not cooperate so the police got very annoyed . . .
all this in front of guest .
On a positive note , we did like having a Trader Joe 's right behind the hotel and used the mini bar to store our goods .
l also enjoyed the morning coffee in the lobby and the free wine .
But not enough to every bring me back here .
People , see the comments !
We just wanted to tell you that this is an ordinary hotel which only has nice location .
Read the comments .
Those who rated Excellent mostly say location is good .
Those with Terrible rateing bad experiences with staff .
We stayed at this hotel with 2 kids in July .
We requeted 2 beds through Expedia and it was confirmed , and they said only 1 - king room was available .
I showed the confirmation , but they did not honor .
The front desk was not helpful so as the manager .
Waisting our valuable time , we finally took it .
Of course that room did not even have a view .
It was my mistake that I expected little as we compromised bed type , but no .
Again people , read the real comments .
This hotel has bad reputation on staff !
Very tired hoel in great location .
This very tired looking hotel in a great location .
My room was very dated and had a view of a high wall , stair well and fire escape !
The bathroom looked as though it had not been decorated since the end of Word War 2 !
On the plus side the staff were very helpful , the restaurant was very good and reasonably priced , the fast free internet and complimentary coffee and cookies in the lobby were nice touches and of course , the location was brilliant .
Great 5 day stay .
I was very pleasently surprised with the service of this hotel .
They do a lot of little things that show they care about their guests .
The hotel is old but kept up very well .
The Wireless Internet service works great but if you do n't have a computer they also have one available by the front desk for guests to use .
The bathrooms are a little small and I felt that it could have been a little cleaner but I consider myself to have very high standards when it comes to how clean the bathrooms are .
We stayed one night at the Downtown Hilton during this visit and would pick the Chancellor over the Hiton any day .
Lovely room , great location .
The Orchard Hotel was a great place to stay in San Francisco .
Lovely room , high quality furniture , good size bathroom and a very big shower .
The rate was excellent for a central city hotel ( just around the corner from Union Square ) and you get free Wi-Fi which is a real bonus .
Breakfast is available at a selection of nearby diners all a couple of minutes walk from the hotel .
I would definitely recommend The Orchard if you 're looking for great quality in a central location at an affordable rate .
Do n't believe the hype .
My wife and I were staying at another hotel while on business and decided to stay the weekend at the Chancellor ( we booked it before we left ) .
Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to the reviews .
The room was small ( not unexpected based upon other reviews ) , the room was very old and in need of a major renovation ( a little surprising ) , the elevator was still broken ( wow - I had assumed that would be fixed . . . how long do these things take to repair ? and how many months ago was that first posting about the elevator being broken ? ) .
Staff - were marginal . They were n't so friendly / helpful but not bad either .
Overall , the hotel did n't live up to the other reviews .
Going back and looking at them now makes me think that they almost look too good to be true .
The hotel is not a diamond in the rough , it is a budget hotel . Not terrible , but not good either .
Great Value and Very clean .
We stayed here with my in - laws and my 14 mo old son in a family suite . It was very spacious and the refrig and micro were great to have .
The free continental breakfast was enough for all of us . ( Donuts , crossants , danishes , muffins , bananas , and apples . )
The parking is tight but doable .
We had a room on the top floor and found it very quiet .
The owners were very friendly .
I have stayed at high end hotels and the only difference is you pay for a beautiful lobby .
I do n't care about a lobby .
Some of the rooms in expensive hotels are more outdated and worn than the rooms here . I found them to be very clean and up to date .
I ca n't find one thing wrong with this hotel .
The location is good , but a 20 - 25 minute walk or so to Fisherman 's Wharf .
I would stay here again , especially when traveling with family or kids .
Call directly for best pricing and for Sr . and AAA discount .
Good value .
We paid $ 109 for our twin room .
The room was small but adequate but the ceiling fan was not enought to cool the room .
We kept the curtains closed for most of the day but it was still hot at night .
The bathroom is very small but the location made up for any downfalls .
The cable car is on the doorstep and Union Square is a two minute walk away .
The constant supply of coffee , cookies and superb fresh apples helped the budget .
The staff were helpful and courteous with a lobby shop that sells transport tickets .
The hotel is very near diners and all that San Francisco has to offer .
A tip , ask for a quiet room at the rear of the hotel , no view but a peaceful sleep .
Pleasant place to stay and a good location .
A good spot for our family of 4 including 2 teenagers .
We had very a large room ( large kitchen area with table , bedroom area with 2 queens and a sofa bed ) at the back of the motel on the top floor - which unlike the previous reviewers room had a panoramic view over the city ( not the courtyard ) we could even see the top of the Golden Gate bridge though I believe we had the only room with this view .
The decor was perhaps a little dated but all was clean .
No problems with TV or phone and free wireless Internet was huge bonus for daughter who wanted to catch up with her friends back home .
We found the location excellent for us , walking distance to most things and SF public transport is excellent .
We avoided breakfast at the hotel completely and went to Polkers on Polk Street ( as recommended by the staff ) for superb breakfasts ( pancakes , waffles etc etc etc you name it they do it ) , we also had an evening meal there which was also excellent and very good value .
We found the staff at Nob Hill were very welcoming and friendly ( despite having to wait up late for us due to a cancelled flight ) They were extremely helpful giving us lots of local info , places to see ( areas to avoid ) etc .
If I was to give a couple of tips for staying in San Francisco they would be avoid Fishermans wharf unless you like really touristy trash and if you want to make the trip to Alcatraz in the summer book it before you go - we had n't done this and found all the trips were booked up for the whole week .
Great Location .
This hotel is situated two blocks from Fisherman 's Wharf .
All the tourist destinations ( ferry to Alcatraz , restaurants , public transportation stops ) are all within reasonable walking distance .
The rooms themselves are quite small but clean .
The staff was very friendly and accomadating with any questions or requests .
Great Value and location .
Great Hotel if you want to be in the heart of San Francisco and yet away from all the traffic noise .
This is in the Financial district which is only a few blocks away from Union Square .
So on weekends everything dies down and you can enjoy peaceful suroundings .
Very well appointed rooms , excellent service and way cheaper than some of the other big names that are not as nice on the interior .
We had some loud partying neighbours and finally called the front desk at 11:45 pm and they took care of it immedately .
Only issue is that Valet parking fee is $ 51 per 24 hrs - WOW !
Suggest street parking on weekends which is free or the St Mary 's Garage close by which is $ 6.50 per weekend night .
You are out of luck on weekdays as parking is expensive everywhere .
Not So Grand Old Dame .
I was assigned to a tiny room in the old ( original ) building .
The corridor and room gave off an offensive odor that I associated immediately with uncleaned carpeting .
After having difficulty sleeping due to the smell and getting little satisfaction from housekeeping , I undertook my own efforts to eliminate it with a fabric spray cleaner .
It took and entire container to do the trick but it succeeded in getting rid of most of it .
I later learned that these small , least desirous rooms are the ones assigned to guests with animals in tow .
There were no drawers to store clothes and no coffee maker in this standard room .
The pricey coffee bar in lobby asked $ 2.75 for a small coffee .
You an do much better a block down Powell at Starbucks .
It seems that management intends to get as much revenue out of this aging dame before re - branding it to a 3 - star property .
It 's so old and has been re - habbed so many times that another attempt could not succeed in meeting Westin standards .
Most of those guests staying in the old building ( as opposed to the newer tower ) appeared to be on package tours from the Pacific room or other international locations , or others who booked discounted rooms .
It 's a shame because , with a little effort directed at cleaning carpets , the entire experience could have been much different .
If you are checking the Westin website , these rooms can be identified as those with no view . '
great alternative to big chain hotels .
bedroom
Stay away during renos .
We stayed here for 4 nights in early / mid February , after much research online and in travel books .
I thought that I had found accommodation that was both within our budget and of high quality .
Yes , there IS construction going on , and it started every morning at 9:00am for us ; if you will be gone by this time , and away until after supper , then there should n't be a problem , provided you have a room facing the courtyard ( away from the busy street in front ) .
Issues we ran into : - Did n't have the room as requested in my reservation , so they had to put me in a queen bed on day 1 , then move to a king days 2 - 4 . -
The first night , we also had to be moved at 2:00am because our ventilation started clicking non - stop - - repair person came , suggested we just move rooms .
Would have been ok , if not for : - Construction at 9:00am each morning .
Heard it loud and clear on floors 2 and 4 . -
Also , placed us in a king suite that was joined with another room via a private doorway ; the noise from the other family with kids was evident as of 7am as well .
But , we could n't move again because there were no other rooms available with king . -
Showed up for breakfast in their restaurant at 10:31am - - I 'm not exaggerating - - would not serve us , since they said they stop taking orders at 10:30am - - the place had one other couple in it - - could they afford to lose business over one minute ?
I guess so .
Perhaps I had higher expectations , or perhaps not . . .
Staff at front desk was fine , obviously the restaurant could use some work . . .
Rooms were clean , always done promptly .
Location was nice for getting all around the city ; we mostly walked from place to place , even to and from downtown along the Embarcadero .
The reno 's look to be in full swing ; I would doubt anything will be winding down in the near future ; I 'd certainly call their front desk and make sure that there are NO renovations being done prior to coming .
Happy travelling !
better for pleasure than business .
As lovely as other kimptons in terms of quality of finish amenities .
Very servicable fitness area , in - room desks with wired net , cute nautical touches .
Right smack in the heart of the tourist waterfront .
I would come back with my spouse for vacation or if you 're a business person dragging family then this would be a great fit .
Some of the rooms are quite spacious and would be good for families .
As a straight business traveler it was a distracting location , with a low noise level that I 'd roll with if I were vacationing too but was hard to not feel curmudgeonly when I had 7:30 am meetings .
Great location .
Stayed at the Parc 55 for one night on Saturday , June 24 .
The lobby is beautiful and the service from the valet and front desk staff is very good .
Overall , the property is very clean and appears to be well maintained .
My room on the tenth floor was also clean , fairly large for a S . F . property , had a decent view and was well appointed .
The bed was actually very comfortable .
I did by the way ask for a complimentary upgrade at check in so its possible that my room was a little nicer than the regular rooms but you often do n't know if you really are being upgraded unless you are a regular and / or are very familiar with the property .
I did not dine at the hotel so I can not comment about the quality of the food at the Parc however I had a drink in the sports bar which was quite small but like any other hotel sports bar .
The Parc 55 is definitely one of the most strategically located hotels in S . F . in my opinion .
Union Square , shopping and great restaurants are all very close and within easy walking distance .
There is also an abundance of stores with wine , food , etc . all around the area if one wanted to get supplies or perhaps their own wine / beer .
One disappointment however was the absence of an in room refrigerator and mini bar which made having any cold snacks or beverages on hand impossible .
The Parc 55 is where the visiting baseball teams stay when they are in town to play the Giants ( at least it used to be and I believe that this is still the case ) .
All in all , I would stay here again in a heartbeat .
Lots to recommend this hotel .
The Rex has a lot of positives .
It is well located , near Union Square with lots of shops and restaurants nearby .
The staff are friendly and the rooms , while small , are clean and well furnished .
There is free wireless Internet access in the rooms and another nice touch is the free glass of wine served between 5 and 6 - this ensures the guests gravitate to the lounge and creates a warm , friendly atmosphere .
We had breakfast in the restuarant and it was good although there are plenty of other good restaurants and diners nearby .
The only fault we would find is in the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms .
All in all , a good value mid range hotel .
Nice staff , tiny room .
The Westin is huge with different elevator banks and hallways - and the staff is wonderful and very friendly .
The building is beautiful both outside and inside - there 's a cafe and some shops available too .
Location is central and on a pretty busy street with all the shops of Union Square right outside .
The trolley is right across the street .
My only complaint is the room . It was TINY .
I live in NYC so I 'm used to small rooms , but this is one small room !
The coffee maker was in the closet .
The entrance door opens right into the bed .
You ca n't have the bathroom door open and the closet door open at the same time .
The walls and doors were super thin .
I heard everything next door - the TV , conversation , yawning - I heard everything in the hall too .
The view was a brick wall .
I think it was just my luck with the room assignment and thank goodness I traveled alone on this trip because this room was really meant for one person .
I 'd go back but I 'd definitely make sure that I had a different room .
Great location for tourists .
Location was great .
Hotel was pretty good too .
Do n't miss the complimentary wine tasting at 5pm every day - great way to meet other travellers and enjoy a glass or two .
Rooms have a fridge which is handy and there are safety deposit boxes available ( not in room which is a little bit of a pain ) .
Within walking distance to everything at Fisherman 's Wharf which is the tourist hub .
There 's a supermarket ( Safeway I think ) next door which is very handy !
Rooms were pretty standard ( we had a 2 x double one which was big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids ) - but it 's the location which sells this place .
not a good hotel . . . .
I spent Tuesday night this week in the Westin St . Francis and it was absolutely the worst hotel stay I have had in years .
Checking in was fine but they had no ' standard rooms ' available so I was asked if I would upgrade and stay in a union square view room that had a murphy bed .
I specifically asked when checking in if the murphy bed was of the same quality as the heavenly beds .
I was assured it was .
The room was ok ( nice flat screen TV ) , but I had asked them to turn down the bed ( ie : flip it down from the wall ) while i was out at dinner .
Arriving back later I ended up in a bed with a 10 cm thick mattress , springs that could be felt through the sheet and this WAS NOT a Heavenly Bed ! ! !
It was absolutely brutal and just like a hide a bed on an old sofa bed .
For 300 per night i was shocked .
Then to top it all off the lady in the room next door started smoking at 5am , in a non smoking hotel .
I eventually called at 645am and security came and stopped the nonsense .
So with the bed being the most important thing i was looking for being completely disappointing , I would have checked out on that basis alone , the smoking was just too much .
I will never stay in this hotel again and can not believe just how bad it was .
This hotel is OLD , needs a renovation desperately so wait until this hotel with a great location does that and then you can stay here .
not worth the price .
I stayed in a standard room for two nights .
The pluses include walking distance to nearby sights and it was clean .
Unfortunately , the first night I could not sleep because my room was located right around from the elevator and conversations and doors slamming echoed throughout the night in my room .
also , whenever the heater kicked on , it was loud .
I switched rooms the next night - - from the 12th floor to the third floor - - which was a bit more quieter but you can still hear doors closing from nearby rooms .
Also , the room was not as nice althought it was to be an exact switch .
The tiny bathroom lacked a window , was a shower only , and it had a toilet flushing system like what you would find in a public facility , where you stepped on the lever .
There were also paint chips on the wall trims .
The staff for the most part were nice and polite .
The only person I thought was inept was the girl I dealt with when I checked in .
I was n't given a map of the city or offered a coupon to a nearby department store , which I did n't know was available until I switched rooms .
Reasonable place to stay in SF .
We stayed overnight at the Castle Inn in San Francisco in November .
It was a fairly convenient to Alcatraz Island and California Academy of Science in Golden Gate Park .
We were looking for a reasonably priced convenient location in SF that we did not have to pay for parking .
Very basic motel with comfortable beds , mini refrig and basic continental breakfast .
It was within walking distance to quite a few restaurants ( Miller 's East Coast Deli - yummy ! )
I did find that the clerk at the desk was rather unfriendly , though helpful .
The free parking spaces were extremely tight for our mini van .
The noise was not too bad , being only 1 block from Van Ness Ave .
If you are looking for a no frills , comfortable place to stay , Castle Inn was a good choice .
Sorely Disappointed With Its Demise .
Let me begin by saying that I have been staying at this hotel since I was a child , and this means I have seen it go through many iterations for over 45 years .
This most recent stay was so utterly disappointing , I simply do not know where to begin .
The recently refurbished lobby on the Union Square side has become this odd assemblage of Art Deco - like seating which one has to wind around just to get through .
It takes some time to recognize that this is the hotel bar !
Prior to this strange transformation , the bar was the lovely Compass Rose , which now houses a restaurant .
The lovely jewelry store on the right was going out of business , and other shops that were a delight over the years no longer exist .
I am a Starwood Preferred Guest , so check - in is never a problem anywhere in the world , and is still fine at St . Francis .
The particular evening I was there , the lines to get up the tower to my room were extraordinary , and the wait excessive .
I will say that the rooms are still decent and the beds comfortable , but there is something that has simply gotten lost overall : the sense of a bygone era , of attention to detail , of feeling that the individual matters .
I am so sorry to see the demise of a crown jewel of San Francisco and reluctantly am going to stay elsewhere on my return to the City .
Roll the dice .
Sold to the highest bidder is the way this place works .
we made reservations months in advance for the first week of december , only to be called a couple of days before our trip and told they accidentally gave our reservation away .
in talking to the manager i was told that it was given away by a travel website by accident , so I asked her why she could not call the people who booked later and cancel them and she said she had no contact info on them ! ! ! are you kidding me ? .
Anyway we were supposed to have the family suite for about $ 180.00 a night and she said that she could give us a room at their sister property Broadway manor for $ 140.00 a night .
As i was talking to her I looked on their website and saw I could get a room for 3 of those nights for $ 59.00 a night , 1 night for $ 99 which she later gave me the discount , but if I had not asked we would have been paying a couple extra hundered for our stay .
Instead of staying in a family suite that we booked months in advance in a hotel that we picked because of tripadvisor , we were packed in a standard room of a lower rated hotel .
We would have stayed elsewhere but it was a high volume week and we could not get anything reasonable on such short notice . ( I 'm sure they got a lot more money for the suite ) .
Being pretty mad about this I started checking other reviews and I realized that if you change the tripadvisor search to lowest rated instead of newest , every person who gave this hotel a 1 , did so because they were duped out of their reservation .
The funny thing is this is the only hotel I have seen with a 48 hour cancellation policy instead of 24 .
I can only rate this hotel a 1 even though I 'm sure it 's alright once you actually get a room , but as Seinfield once said taking the reservation is easy , it 's actually about holding the reservation .
Roll the dice if you want , just have a backup plan .
Would love to hear a response from management !
It was . . . average .
The front desk staff was very helpful they even got us a rate lower than what the website quoted ( $ 210 vs . 245 ) .
they were very accomodating by letting us check - in late at midnite after our long drive from LA .
we ordered room service and they were out of almost everything . so we picked what was left : a mediocre sandwiich and cheese plate .
the room service took forever , we were informed they were understaffed that night ( odd for a friday night ) .
our bathroom lights had a flickering problem , but the room was pretty spacious .
the decor our standard was a letdown compared to the extravagance of the lobby .
i was also dissappointed with the sheets , they were a little rough .
i expected more for the prices they charge but you ca n't beat their location !
Great location , but bring your earplugs .
Just got back from a 3 - day stay at the Parc 55 .
The hotel is in a great location near the Powell Street cable car stop .
The room was decent too .
The only big problem was the noise .
The walls are paper thin !
I could hear every single word the people next door said .
After a couple of hours , I went down to the lobby and asked to be switched to a new room .
Same problem with the new room . . .
I could hear my new neighbor 's entire conversation .
I switched rooms AGAIN and the third room was fine .
Make sure you do n't get a room with an adjoining room !
The staff was nice about changing my room - they probably get this complaint often . . .
Overall a very good hotel .
We stayed there while attending a convention at the nearby Moscone Center .
Found it to be a great central location right off Market Street next to a BART station .
Did all our sightseeing from there by foot , streetcar , and BART train .
The room was attractive , done in red , gold , and dark wood - - adequate in size and comfortable though not quite spacious .
The bed , linens , blanket , and pillows were not of the best quality , should be upgraded .
The view from our 25th - floor room through a large bay window facing east was very pleasant .
Housekeeping did a superb job , keeping the room and bathroom spotless .
Having no safe in the room was a hugh inconvenience especially since it usually took so long for a front desk agent to assist you at the boxes downstairs .
The Renaissance Club Lounge on the 31st floor had a breathtaking view , and the complimentary breakfast was excellent .
Most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful .
Would we stay there again ? Absolutely !
4 nights no sleep .
We stayed in this hotel from 10 - 14 October 07 and did not get a full night 's sleep in that time .
The weekend nights were horrendous , we were kept awake for nearly 2 hours each night with the noise of what we assume were people leaving local clubs .
As a result we were too tired to enjoy our visit to San Francisco and have decided never to go there again .
I also found the room was much too small with a tiny closet and nowhere to store luggage , and the restaurant to be expensive , particularly when you share the very limited space with the bar and can not enjoy your meal without noise .
The only good thing about our stay in this hotel was the nightly wine reception but that certainly was not enough to make up for the down sides .
My advice is if you like your sleep do not stay at this hotel .
A four star hotel ? Haha . . .
My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for one night using expedia .
We thought it would be a fabulous night in a four star hotel .
A treat really .
HA !
What a joke .
From the moment we walked into the hotel there was nothing but trouble .
The room we requested was not even a possibility when we got there ( even though it was posted on expedia ) .
The towels were no bigger than a face cloth , the sheets were too short for the bed , so our feet touched the matress .
When we requested proper bedding - we were questioned , no sorry , interegated before they would send someone up .
The concierge knew nothing about the city .
And the managers kept passing the buck as to ' who 's fault all the problems fell to ' .
They gave us no compensation for our troubles . . . oops . . . except for a bag of about 15 covered nuts . HA . . .
What a ridiculous experience for the over $ 350 we spent on the tackiest room I 've ever seen .
Oh ya ' . . . do n't forget to check out the leapord print old robes .
That 's a site .
A terrible experience . . . just terrible .
Overpriced .
Whilst we do n't doubt that the hotel was clean , it was sorely overpriced and very unfriendly .
There seems to be no soundproofing in between rooms and we had to ask to be moved after our first night , only to find we had the same problem where we were moved to .
Whilst some of the staff were friendly to a point , we were disappointed with the service when comparing it to other hotels of the same standard .
In short , there are better places you could stay in San Fran .
The Rock ! !
The hotel is very nice .
Its also in a fantastic location in San Francisco .
We were however very disappointed in the quality of the mattress .
We stayed here four nights - by the end of the trip my back was hurting ! !
I really would expect a better mattress than a rock ( the mattresses in Alcatraz were more comfy than the hotel ) ! !
The pillow was very nice !
The continental breakfast at the hotel was awful !
It was cereal , cold muffins , croissants , and some fruits .
Great friendly place to stay .
Nob Hill Inn is a really good place to stay .
The owners know almost everything there is to know about San Francisco - they 'll tell you where to visit ( and where not to ) and how to get there .
The rooms are large and comfortable ( your above average standard room really ) .
If you have a car , you can park here , which is a real bonus in a city where parking is limited .
The Inn is fairly well located - although it 's in a residential area , so there 's not a great deal of nightlife .
There are some nice little restaurants nearby as you walk towards Hyde .
Muni travel passes ( the 3 day passes are a real bargain if you plan to be in the city that long ) can be bought from the Holiday Inn on Van Ness .
This Inn has a good reputation and when we were there it was fully booked and it seemed that the majority of the guests had been there before which is always a good sign .
Definitely to be recommended if you want a standard room in a handy location .
our stay at chancellor .
After reading all the positive reviews on the Chancellor we decided to try it .
We signed up for the family suite package as we were traveling with a child .
Our one main criticism that actually made us leave was that there were no appropriate channels on the tv for kids , no vcr and no way to hook one up .
I realize other people may not care about this but after a busy day of sightseeing , we like to relax and watch TV and we couldn ' t .
I was surprised that there was no Disney channel or Nick or Cartoon network or any child friendly channel when they called it a family suite .
It was also a bit too noisy for us as there was a street performer just under our window .
We also had requested a refrigerator which was confirmed at least twice but when we got there we never got it .
We moved to the Hyatt Embarcadero which all around was a better fit for us .
Efficient but not great value .
We stayed at this hotel at the end of a trip travelling around California .
When we started our trip we stayed at the excellent Donatello , but unfortunately they had no rooms available when we returned to the city .
The Omni was expensive and although it did everything it is meant to do it did it without any soul .
We booked through Priceline a room with two double beds .
On arrival Reception said that as this was booked through a third party it could not be guaranteed and so we had to have a bed made up for our daughter .
I have no criticisms of the room , apart perhaps that everything being a bit too frilly - not really our style .
I was irritated to have to pay $ 10 for access to the hotel wifi - why do the cheaper hotels and motels provide this free and the more expensive hotels charge for this ?
The breakfast was over formal and as their is no buffet we ordered dishes that were OK , but extremely over priced .
The staff were efficient and the doorman friendly , but I would not stay at this hotel again .
Unpleasant experience .
We had a problem with our hotel stay .
The night clerk mistakenly telephoned our room at 5:30 a . m . on a Saturday morning .
He was looking for the room that had ordered a car .
We were on vacation and had hoped to sleep until at least 8:00 a . m .
Neither of us were able to go back to sleep because of the noise from the courtyard below and because of the noise from the housekeeping staff .
The housekeeping staff was very loud in the mornings .
They knock loudly on each door and laugh and joke in the hallway as early as 7:00 a . m .
This is okay if you are a business traveler .
We were on a romantic getaway .
This is not the place to stay if you are on a romatice getaway .
Noisy + Rude does not equal good hotel .
Stayed in August 2004 for 6 nights too many .
After the first night when we could hear EVERYTHING in the adjacent rooms from normal talking to laughing and from in - room movies to neighbor 's bathroom visists , we should have left .
Second night was the worst as there was a party in the next room from about 11:00 pm - 1:30 am .
The staff did not think the noise level was anything to complain about and told us such .
Additionally , the front desk was less then friendly when we cashed traveler 's checks , even though they said it was policy to cash them .
And to top off , the doormen seemed to think it was n't their duty to hold open doors or greet patrons .
I vacation at least one week a year in San Francisco , and I would NEVER stay at this hotel again .
a gentle stay .
the first impression was slightly dissapointing , not as glitsy as the website portrayed and the staff were very busy .
However , after the first day the staff were attentive and I saw past the very ordinary facade of this little gem of a hotel .
I t is situated beautifully for sightseeing by cable car and walking to the stores .
Breakfast is a little monotinous but good food .
Watchout for the confusing booking proceedure that myself and a few other guests fell into .
We thought we had payed for our stay but had only reserved our room .
1 poor guest had to borrow money to pay the bill .
Laura Meith .
I was visiting from a three day layover flight from Boston , and I wanted to visit the wharf .
I was recommended to the hotel from a dear friend of mine .
The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .
They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .
During my stay I complained about a dent that was put in my rental car by a valet , and I was directed to speak with the Assistant General Manager Laura Meith . She was rude and insincere about repairing the damage done to my vehicle .
I will never stay there again because of this incident .
The valet parking was overpriced , the service was terrible , and the coffe was cold .
Take my word for it , stay at the Hilton or the Marriot .
Full marks for friendliness .
We stayed here in July at the beginning of our family trip to California , Nevada and Arizona .
We stayed in 11 hotels and even though many of them were swankier , Varsa and Sy more than made up for it because they were just SO helpful and friendly ( thank you ! ) .
Great location , clean , free parking and free breakfast .
Enjoyed eating out at Polkers just round the corner .
We would n't hesitate to return .
Outstanding service .
The people at the Hotel Rex were outstanding !
We gave 110 % to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable .
The room was somewhat small but tastefully decorated and the bed was wonderful .
Great place to stay .
Our first trip to San Francisco .
The Castle Inn is in a great location to explore the city and great value for money .
Very friendly and helpful reception on arrival and throughout our 3 night stay .
Spacious room .
Our 2 young children enjoyed riding the elevator !
The free parking is great and no need to use the car at all while exploring the city .
Recommended .
Fantastic location !
For us , this hotel was an excellent location .
It was close to my husband 's conference , next to shopping , walking distance to China town , and even a little further ( but still walking distance ) to North Beach Fishermans ' Wharf .
The hotel was better than average but nothing spectacular .
We were there for 8 nights , with a complimentary upgrade to the 28th floor in the Tower .
Glass elevator was great !
Views were fantastic .
Cleaning was done daily , but not consistently ( ie tea / toiletries sometimes replaced ) .
Hotel is very large and very busy , it therefore lacked a more personal touch .
Overall though , it was good .
Nice , but not a wow .
This is the second time I have stayed at the Omni , both on business .
The Omni is a nice 4 star hotel .
The rooms and bathrooms are of average size , but quite adequate .
The furnishings are in good condition except for the carpet which is very tired and in need of replacing .
The worn state of the carpet really detracts from the rest of the room .
The internet connection , although it uses a wire , was fast and reliable ( $ 10 / day ) .
The staff was very friendly and helpful .
For example , they set up transportation for me on multiple days without a hitch .
The hotel food is only average in quality , but very expensive .
The hotel is located not far from anything , but not close to anything either ; a geographical compromise .
I timed the walk to Union Square at 15 minutes via Montgomery , hang a right at Post ( note this way is flat , no hills ) .
San Francisco hotels are very expensive for what you get .
The Omni is better than both nearby Hyatts .
I would stay there again , but will likely try another hotel on my next visit .
Good experience .
We stayed at The Omni in San Francisco for 3 nights while we went on a wine tour in Sedona .
The service was good , the rooms were fine , and it was an overall good experience .
I have stayed in nicer hotels , but this was in a good location to sight seeing and shopping .
The rooms were quiet and the beds were confortable enough .
We did , however eat at the restaurnant downstairs for dinner and breakfast and had some issues .
The food was good , but the service was not .
Waiters were slightly rude and one night at dinner we had to go find the hostess to be seated .
We stood there for over 15 minutes .
Across the street there is a stop for the trolley and the bellman was good about helping us hail taxis .
One night they even had the hotel car take us to the pier for our alcatraz tour .
Overall we had a good experience at this hotel and would recommend it to others .
Shopperholics .
Dream Located right in the centre of SF on Union Square within walking distance of Chinatown , top boutiques and restaurants .
We were in the older tower ( newer high rise behind it ) and although the bedroom was spacious the bathroom was tiny and in need of refurbishment .
The standard of cleaning left a lot to be desired and the main restaurant could not be booked at short notice for dinner because of the patronage of SF 's rich and wealthy .
However , one thing one wo n't do in SF is starve , as there are plenty of eateries close by .
Hotel amenities included fitness and health spa plus business centre , however , other than the location there was really nothing to raise the hotel out of the average catagory .
Service , Service , Service .
Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Argonaut with my elderly mother .
The staff at this hotel was unbelievable - from the moment we pulled up to the curb until we pulled away , the level of service was exceptional and almost everyone we met was extremely friendly .
Our stay at the hotel turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip .
The room was spacious and extremely comfortable .
We loved the decor and the staff uniforms .
No noise problems as others have experienced .
We found a great rate on the internet , then called the hotel directly and they matched the rate .
If you go , try Joanies behind the hotel for a great breakfast and Capurro 's across the street for a good dinner .
Parking at the garage on Beach St behind the hotel is only $ 26 overnight .
The St . Francis Hotel Haunted ? . . .
My husband and I checked in at this hotel and were told that the hotel was sold out and the only rooms they had available were standard rooms with one full size bed .
We were given a room on the 3rd floor in the old part of the hotel .
The lobby was beautiful but as soon as we approached the elevator we felt very creepy .
The door to the elevator was brass and huge but the elevator was small inside .
We got out of the elevator and found ourselves in these creepy long hallways with red carpeting .
There were staircases and we heard people walking up and down the staircase but did n't see anyone .
The hallways were very long and narrow and the room numbers on the door were not in order .
We proceeded to our room and were amazed to see that the adjacent doors were in a 45 degree angle .
As soon as we opened the door we felt goosebumps .
The room was very small with a small bed and a T . V that was not directly across from the bed .
It was freezing cold in the room and the thermostat said it was 60 degrees .
We were wearing jackets and were still freezing .
We set the temperature to 80 degrees .
But the room did not seem to warm up at all .
We got up and looked out of the window and saw another window about 10 feet away .
There was a walkway between the two windows which seemed very freaky and unsafe .
I went to go brush my teeth and get ready for bed .
When I got out of the bathroom I noticed the curtain of the window blowing .
I moved the curtain and saw that the window was open .
I freaked out and ran to my husband and grabbed his arm .
He looked at the window and confirmed that the same window we looked out of that was shut ten minutes ago was now open .
We grabbed our bags and ran out of the room in our pajamas .
Also the chandelier made a shadow on the wall that did n't look anything like the chandilier .
It looked like three images of people with there arms up like they were about to attack us .
Also when we sat in this room for about half an hour we noticed that the curtain of the other window kept sliding open about an inch every few minutes .
And , while we sat in the room for and debated whether or not to stay here we heard doors opening and closing next door but when we looked out of the peephole we did n't see anything .
However we heard woices of two men arguing .
This was a very scary experience .
I have read a lot of good reviews about the hotels new tower , which maybe true but I really feel that there is something freaky about the old tower and that we were not alone in this room .
Whoever was in it with us wanted us to leave . . . .
Problematic Stay .
Stayed over the Memorial Day weekend .
During our stay , the only elevator went down and during our last day , the water was out . . .
no toilets or shower ! ! !
Exception or typical ?
Staff resisted honoring the $ 50 discount promised .
Unlikely that we will return .
Great base in SF .
Great place to use as a base to explore some of San Francisco - far better than the overpriced and tatty Fisherman 's Wharf Marriott I stayed in last year .
Friendly staff , clean rooms with plenty of space and easy walking distance from Fisherman 's Wharf and Chinatown .
I did n't find the parking a problem - it may depend on the size of your car !
No surprise that it 's on a fairly decent hill but that 's half the fun of San Francisco !
I 'll definitely be back again and the Nob Hill Motor Inn is my new recommendation for anyone asking about places to stay in San Francisco .
curate 's egg .
Accepting that centrally located elderly hotels in San Francisco are going to have to operate within space constraints , this hotel had one huge problem .
It has only one small elevator so that , if it is not actually already being used by room service or the maids , you may have to share a ride with well virtually anything that needs to go up or come down in a hotel .
The location also means that daylight is at a premium in the hotel and the general lack of direct light was amplified by some very earthy coloured decor ( presumably because of the style being sought ) .
This is particularly pronounced on the stairs .
There is no natural light and the artificial light is not overly bright , yet they have laid brown striped carpet which makes it very difficult to see the edge of the stair tread .
With the elevator problem making recourse to the stairs for descent ( even at four floors up ) a more frequent then usual occurrence , particular care had to be taken .
The room , whilst generously proportioned and quiet , also lacked daylight and was not brightly lit artificially . It was a bit depressing .
The bathroom / shower was good for such an old building .
The lack of coffee / tea making facilities was not helpful particularly since the bar served dreadful coffee ( we did n't dare ask about tea ) .
Staff were helpful , although some seemed overly commission motivated , and there was no one to help with cases .
The location is very good .
booking confirmed - room unavailable on arrival .
Although I booked my room through the hotel website , it turned out to be unavailabe when I arrived .
I was sent to a nearby hotel ( also property of the the Nob Hill owner ) with a terrible person at the front desk .
In the end , I decided to look for another hotel myself .
do not waste your money $ $ $ - stay at another vip hotel .
I read through many reviews on this site and found that this hotel seem to have the best and after friends and family said it would be nice for the location , I chose to stay .
What a mistake !
There are too many more hotels to choose from - do n't make the same mistake I did .
I did fill out the survey card left with my express check out .
The next morning I received an email from the hotel , I assume it was a courtesy email that everyone gets after their stay .
My response to their question : Please let us know how your stay was Dear , XXXI think it is important for you to know what you customers experience so that in the future other customers will not have to experience the same .
I was very excited about staying at your hotel as friends and co - workers told me that it was a great location and one of the nicest that they had heard of , and some even had family and friends stay there when they visited .
My son came to visit me for the weekend and most all the hotels were booked in the area .
I usually stay at the Hyatt Regency on Embarcadero however ; they were booked for the nights we wanted to stay in the city .
I have four adult children , two grandchildren , and many friends that visit from Texas , Montana , and Florida often and enjoy staying in the city a couple of nights when they visit .
For some they love the Union Square area for shopping and others love the Wharf .
Our stay did not get off on the right foot to begin with , we arrived in the city about 1:45PM and I called ahead to see if I could valet my car and see when the earliest we could check in , I hoped for 2:00 or 2:30PM since my reservation said 3PM check in .
The person at the front desk told me that my room would not be ready until 4 or 5pm because the guests in that room had a late check out .
When I said is that the only room you have , they said yes with the view you want and the high floor .
They told me that housekeeping would not be able to finish those high floors before 4 or 5pm and that I could have a lower floor without a view of the city .
I was n't to happy about that since we had arrived expecting to check in at least by 3pm , get dressed for our adventure on the night Alcatraz tour at 5:15pm .
We were very disappointed that we had to wait around in the rain and not be able to change for the 5:15PM tour as we had planned .
It was not a good situation .
However , we made the best of it and after the tour on the Island ; we arrive late at the hotel and checked in .
I would have thought that if a guest were paying over $ 600.00 dollars a night for a room the quality of service would have been a lot better .
I could have stayed at a motel 6 and got the same customer service .
Your staff did not seem to care weather we got our room or not , there was a too bad attitude and I did not care much for that .
In the morning we went out the front door about 10:50AM and ask the door man standing on the curb where the best place to have breakfast was , he laughed at me and said , " Lady breakfast is over by 11AM everywhere and your not going to find it anywhere " .
You might tell your doorman that just a few doors down on the same block they have breakfast and 2 - blocks up there is a great little dinner that offer 's it 24 / 7 .
Our experience was less than wonderful , and your staff was rude for the exception of the bellhop that helped us out the next morning and valet .
I was not impressed with the bellhop that delivered our bags to our room since he was at the elevator before us and as I rounded the corner by the Concierge Desk , I noticed a black leather jacket lying on the floor .
As I passed by it , I thought wow that looks like mine and when I turned the corner where the elevators where there was our cart and the bellhop was being told he dropped something and he went back to pickup my jacket off of the floor .
I room was nice however I was surprise with the quality of the TV , not what I expected for such an elaborately decorated Hotel .
Furniture was different colors of wood , looked bad like they just through whatever they had in there .
Overall , I think it could have been a great stay and I am sure not all of your guests experience the same as we did ; however , the cost in no way equaled our experience .
That night I would have preferred to drive 35 minutes back to Sam Ramon and stay at my own house .
I would not plan to stay at this hotel again and I would most likely not recommend it as I do not feel the quality of customer service is there since there were more than two individuals employed there that were not customer friendly .
On a lighter note , I do want you to know that I am more often motivated to right a job well done letter to companies , rather than a disappointed letter , as I believe everyone has a bad day .
I made this an exception because it just seemed so not right for the value .
I am all about customer service , you can have the greatest product to offer , however if it is not presented well , it has no value to me .
I hope you will investigate and make improvements for your future guests as I think your hotel is beautiful on the surface .
Respectfully , Guest in room 3084 The response I got was from another department head asking me to name names , like I ran around the whole time , taking names and wasting my time on their problems .
I gave enough information to them that they could have verified that I did check in late and I valeted around 2PM that day , why would I have hung out in the rain , if anyone remembers it rained hard on Oct 12th .
I have to give them credit for offerring to upgrade my next stay , like I would through away any more money on that to see if I could be any more miserable .
NOT , I declined the anytime upgrade and you know why , I think someone should have called me in person , but they did n't they chose to email me back an forth , wasting more of my time for nothing .
If they really did have the attitude that they strive for the best , they would have offered me a free night , even if it was an off - night to show me the service could be better .
I did n't want anything free however the thought would have made the differenc for me .
The rooms are NOT worth the money my total was $ 618 for one night , imagine I knew that before I booked it , that is why I booked a nice hotel .
Oh ! well we live and we learn , I have stayed at better and look forward to better nights in SFO when my family and friends visit .
If you chose to stay here , I hope you get better treatment than I do .
And FYI - there are a lot of places that serve breakfast after 11AM .
Have a great day , Unhappy guest that stayed at this hotel .
Wonderful time .
My family and I spent June 25 through 27 at the Argonaut and loved it .
We were steered here by the reviews on Trip Advisor and we knew we made the right choice .
First of all is the location . . . right on Fisherman 's Wharf and one block from the Powell and Hyde cable car stop .
It is located towards the Golden Gate side of the wharf , near its end and away from the wharf bustle , but certainly close enough to enjoy everything .
The hotel was spotless and the staff very attentive and personable .
The only minor glitch was a slight delay in having our bags arrive to our room , but this was very minor .
The hotel has a very nautical theme to it which we found charming .
If a theme hotel is not your bag , then reconsider the choice , but reconsider with much hesitation .
A recent review criticized how tacky the theme was .
Well , considering that every site that lists the hotel ( including its own web site ) mentions the heavy nautical theme , the reviewer should have realized this before booking .
You get alot for the price of the room and considering how expensive SF is , there is alot to be said for that .
Although there is no pool or other significant child oriented stuff , my 11 and 8 year olds loved the hotel , especially for its nautical orientation .
Kids are certainly not out of place in this boutique - style hotel .
There is a restaurant on site which serves breakfast , lunch , and dinner . The food was fine , but a tad pricey .
You definitely need to explore more of the wharf and the city to get better food .
Parking is also expensive - forty bucks a day including tax , but parking is a premium in SF .
Would definitely stay here again .
very overrated .
my wife and i stayed for five nights at the castle inn and found it very overrated in respect of the reviews it gets .
it was reasonably clean and tidy , but really just a room to sleep in , in a fairly good location .
we paid the same amount in new york and got far better accomodation , we read all the reviews before we came and thought we were staying somewhere special , we were wrong .
Shows its age even in the Tower Wing but quiet Friendly check in which was quick and easy .
All staff we met were very helpful .
Our Room was on the 20th floor and a decent size .
It was in the newer Tower Wing .
As with all Westin hotels rooms it had very comfortable beds .
Bathrooms are in marble and were maybe the nicest part of the room .
The room was cleaned extremely well .
Only real fault was a reading light that was completely broken and although we mentioned it to the cleaning lady after 5 nights it still was broken and looked likely to fall at any moment .
The floor was a Starwood Preferred Floor but not sure what was different .
You still have to pay $ 10 a day for Internet !
Have stayed at the Hyatt on Union Square and I found this hotel quieter .
The view was decent though just a few floors higher it would have been much nicer .
The corridors could definitely do with redecorating and look from a different decade .
Seems a shame as the rooms themselves seem more up to date .
Great SF Home Base ! ! !
We stayed here for two nights during the week and were very satisfied with the room .
The rooms are clean and basic , and included a fridge and microwave .
Also , included each morning was a small continental breakfast available at the office .
And , to my surprise , the friendly staff gave us some tourist advice !
The big benefit to the Castle Inn was the free parking .
Parking - a rare commodity in San Francisco .
The secret to seeing San Francisco is using the public transportation .
We left our car at the Castle Inn the whole time during our stay .
The only issue with the Castle Inn is that it 's not that close to the major attractions like Chinatown and Fisherman 's Wharf .
It 's walkable , but it would be a very long walk .
But , you can get anywhere in the City by public bus - only takes a few minutes .
We 'll look forward to staying at the Castle Inn in the future !
Bon Voyage !
what a disapointment .
This hotel goes out of its way to make sure people do not return .
Over priced slovenly appearance , shabby in places and many staff who do not appear to understand to easiest request .
First room was like a rabbit hutch and smelly with paper peeling off wall .
Up graded for a fee to a better room which was satisfactory but still badly in need of redecoration .
No real sign of management at any time .
A great let down after so much looking forward .
Overpriced fare for standard experience view
Great Hotel , Great Location .
We booked this hotel as a result of the excellent tripadvisor reviews it had received and we are glad to report they were accurate ! !
We stayed in a bayview room which had a superb view , overlooking the Hyde Powell Cable car turnaround and the Golden Gate Bridge .
The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was spotlessly clean .
We really enjoyed the evening wine tasting and would have no hesitation in staying again
Amazing Find !
I stayed at this hotel because of a booking on Priceline .
I got a GREAT price on the hotel and was extremely happy with the hotel .
First , it is in a fantastic location - blocks from Fisherman 's Wharf and within walking distance to so many things !
Right from checking in , the staff was unbelievable !
Every single staff member we came into contact with was extremely helpful and very nice !
The room was on the smaller side but there was definitely enough room for two of us .
The coffee , tea and biscotti in the morning is very nice .
I would highly recommend this hotel ! !
Rate confusion .
One time I paid $ 89 , the other time close to $ 200 .
How much are the rooms really worth ?
Probably closer to the first rate .
However , if you 're labeled as a cheapo traveler with a low rate , do n't be surprised if you get treated accordingly .
You may end up in a sub - par room and not get much attention . . .
Location is great if you 're doing business in the Financial District .
However , if you are visiting for fun , this neighborhood is b - o - r - i - n - g , especially on the weekends .
Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for any services within the hotel ( food , drinks , room service , etc . - all very very expensive ! ) .
We would not recommend the Argonaut Hotel .
We were rather disappointed during our recent stay .
After much research we opted to stay at the Argonaut .
Though a suitable hotel it certainly was not of the high caliber that we expected .
The interior was a bit overboard and rather dismal .
The staff was the biggest disappointment .
We have stayed in hotels the world over and have never been presented with a surly staff until our stay at the Argonaut .
We are not demanding guests nor are we rude so one can imagine our shock when a staff member hung up the phone during a conversation that we initiated requesting that a hair dryer in working order be sent to the room .
Guest services can be a demanding career choice but if one is not up to the job at hand there are a host of career options more suitable .
I think a couple of the members of the staff at the Argonaut need to contemplate their respective career choices .
Loved it as usual . . . will be going back in June .
While my husband and I live in Marin County , which is only 25 minutes away from The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco , we love going there for the weekend .
When we do several times a year we always stay at the Orchard Hotel on Bush and Powell Streets .
We were just there last weekend ( May 24 and 25th ) to celebrate my birthday . . . and as usual the hospitality was A + .
We also love the decor and the location - - we are a block from China Town .
Would highly recommend this hotel for out of towners or locals like ourselves .
some disappointments .
We 'd heard a lot of good things about the Tuscan Inn from people who 'd stayed there for a night or two before cruising out of the port of San Francisco .
Normally we 'd stay at the SF Hilton , or one of the Marriott properties , but we decided this time to try something else .
The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed , the bed was comfortable the chairs , TV adequate , the bathroom reasonably good .
Street noise can be a problem in an outside room , though , and the window coverings ( sliding Roman blinds that do n't quite meet ) left a lot to be desired if you do n't want to get up with the sun .
Housekeeping service was very inadequate , though .
We left the room at 10:30 AM , placing the please make up room tag in the key slot .
There were at least 4 , and maybe 6 , housekeeping carts between our room the elevator .
Yet when we returned at 3:30 the room had n't been touched !
The attached restaurant ( Cafe Pescadore ) is open for breakfast with a fairly skimpy menu - but quite good coffee .
On balance , it was an OK place to stay but , perhaps , not to return to .
It 's fine if it 's convenient to what you 're doing in the city .
Reasonable value for money .
Hotels in SF are not cheap , and room sizes are not overly big , so a pretty tiny room for $ 180 was no big surprise .
Valet parking for $ 40 per night seems a bit steep , but at least the service was efficient and quick .
Overall the Tuscan Inn is a nice hotel . very clean , well maintained , with efficient , if not overly friendly service .
the couple of faults with room features were fixed very quickly , which was a nice change from the interminable wait often suffered in European properties .
The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee / bisc service in the morning , and this is quite nice .
I 'd say that , as far as the evening ( 5 to 6 ) wine service is concerned , if you happen to be in the hotel , it 's fine .
But not worth rushing back from a day out for .
Breakfast was OK , but expensive .
Much better option is Pats Cafe , just round the corner nr the cable car terminus .
Do n't stay at this hotel !
What a huge disappointment !
When I first checked in I was very optimistic .
I was willing to overlook the fact that my shower did n't drain properly or the fact that the bedding was a major step below the major hotels because I like to stay at boutique hotels when possible .
I stayed at Hotel Rex for 3 nights on business .
When I returned to the hotel on my third night , at approximately 11:00PM , my key did n't work .
I went down to the front desk only to find out that they had MOVED MY BAGS AND ALL OF MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS TO A DIFFERENT ROOM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION !
Needless to say I was extremely upset .
The manager proceeded to tell me that the room I was in was booked for a wedding party and they had no choice but to move me to another room .
They claim they made several attempts to contact me however I never received a phone call , one e - mail was sent however I did n't receive it !
Regardless , I am still furious over this !
Never before in my 20 + years of travel have I been treated this way .
They offered to comp my 3rd night , nice gesture hey !
I urged the manager to comp my entire stay or I was going to fight this with AMEX to no avail , they were so pompus that they in fact billed me for my first two nights . . .
Business travelers beware !
If it happened to me , it can happen to you . . .
Stay at the Grand Hyatt right across the street . It 's cheaper and the rooms are much nicer !
A Very Pleasant Surprise .
We have all seen the nice staged pictures of hotels online - and more times than not , they do not measure up .
However , the Argonaut was EXACTLY like the pictures and description and more .
The rooms were larger than SF standard .
The beds , linen , cleanliness were impeccable .
Having a second window would have been nice .
The rooms were quiet .
The wine hour was delightful .
Location was convienent - and not in the throes of the typical ' Fisheman 's wharf ' tshirt shops etc .
A classy , comfort , pleasant hotel .
The concierge department could use some assistance . . but they can at least guide you if you new to the area .
Yuck .
Disappointed in my experience here - a hotel trying to compete with luxury chains that just does n't get it . - -
Booked a room with a view on a high floor .
Got a room on a low floor .
They did n't bother to refund the difference ( $ 40 / night ) until I asked . - -
Booked a non - smoking room and it stinks of smoke . - -
Service is mediocre - - nobody answers at the front desk .
Though some individuals try to be helpful .
Overall I would not recommend .
Just Ok .
We selected the hotel because of location and we had a good rate , $ 139.00 per night .
We stayed from Jun 30 - Jul 5 .
Check in was terrible .
Eventhough I booked the hotel 6 months in advance and I sent an e - mail re - confirming my late arrival and my requested room ( no - smoking , 2 double beds ) , they did n't have it and I needed to change rooms the following day .
New room was clean and had a great view of the city .
Parking was pricey but convenient , too many homeless in the area .
If IT WAS N'T FOR THE HOMELESS , the location of this hotel is very good ; a minute walk from BART , cable car turn - around , muni buses , many shops .
The visitor center is a block away , very convenient .
Express check out was easy and fast .
I think I will not stay again .
Cheap construction - get a top floor room .
Great Managers - Lousy room - Cheap construction - Could hear the upstairs neighbor every time they got out of bed - creak , creak , creak .
Omni shmomni . . .
My family and I visited S . F . 12 / 27 - 12 / 30 and stayed at the Omni .
We requested a roll - a - way bed and were given an inflatable bed .
We stayed in the signature room which was suposed to have upgraded furnishings and amenities ( for an upgraded price ) .
I called the hotel directly three times to confirm and to make sure our requests of a king bed and roll - a - way bed were received .
We thought it might be cleaner than the deluxe room we stayed in on a previous visit . It was not .
The carpet was stained in several places and the furniture needs refurbishing .
The light fixtures in the bathroom were still caked with dust .
The mgr could not understand why an inflatable bed was unaccepatble , but moved us to a mini suite after much effort ( two hours of back and forth - you know ) .
This room was long and narrow with one small window . It was dirty and dreary and had a bowl of rotten fruit in a silver bowl waiting for us .
The bathroom was even worse .
It had no tub , just a huge , mildewed and cracked shower with a weird wooden bench and bars everywhere .
When I called the mgr to tell her this was not ok she told me this was the handicap suite and all she had .
It did have a kingsize sofa bed in it with dirty , musty linens on it .
We took this over the inflatable bed but we were not happy .
The doormen are very aggressive and have never turned down a tip for us . .
Also , do not join select guest .
I did and I also called them to confirm our reservation and got nothing that I could see .
I think there have been some fake reviews here . . . Hmm . . .
Great Hotel and Location .
Great Hotel very central for sightseeing .
We booked a club room thinking it would be big , but it was quite small compared to other places we stayed in .
Everything was great except for breakfast , which is served in the club lounge on the top floor ( great view ) , but unless you are early it 's a bit of a bun fight and the quality was not great .
The canapes and desserts offered at other times of the day as part of the package were great .
Jerks .
My husband and I always try to get away on the anniversary of our only child 's death , March 31st .
I had read about the Tuscan Inn and booked it well in advance for our arrival .
It sounded like a great place to be for the occasion .
We took a train from Santa Barbara , and I knew we were going to arrive quite late .
I was looking forward to the assurance of our lovely room awaiting us .
As it turned out , we arrived at around 3:00 A . M . totally exhausted .
We were supposed to have arrived around 10 P . M .
But I had guaranteed with my credit card , so I knew we could just get there and go to sleep .
Well we arrived and THEY HAD SOLD OUR ROOM !
I was totally shocked .
The snide , sadistic clerk at the desk was completely unapologetic and sarcastic .
QUINN .
He said he found us another room that was like the one we 'd reserved non - smoking King .
We also always look for free wi-fi .
We were taken to another hotel where the room was totally reeking of cigarettes , because it was a smoking room , and 2 twin beds .
By then it was almost 4:00 A . M .
Internet access was not free .
I was so upset and angry , and that desk clerk is nothing but a black hole for Best Western 's public relations .
There was no MISTAKE - there was no MISUNDERSTANDING
But there was an abundance of ill will and greed .
If a late arrival guarantee has NO meaning , and is not honored by the hotel , than how can I trust their hospitality code ?
I have NEVER had such a crappy experience at a hotel .
I really feel that he sized us up and decided to try to wield power , because there was nothing we could do .
I will tell all my friends about this , and we are not , despite Quinn 's assessment of our social status , a bunch of unsophisticated hillbillies .
This was way below terrible .
Over rated .
Just back from a 4 night stay at the Argonaut .
Read the rave reviews and decided to try it .
I have to say that I think it is hugely over rated .
The nautical theme is taken too far and the room decor is over the top , bordering on Kitsch .
As there are 2 adults and 2 teenagers in our family , I rang the hotel a couple of weeks before arriving to ask about a rollaway and was told that it could be requested and would cost USD20 per night .
I was subsequently advised a week before arrival by our booking agent that the hotel could give us a room with 2 double beds but could not permit a rollaway .
Our room was quite narrow , 2 double beds and very limited storage space , 1 closet and 2 drawers under the TV .
Bathroom was quite small , made even smaller by their positioning the coffee maker beside the sink !
We had an interior view room , despite having booked a ' Deluxe ' category room We had stayed at the Quality Inn Midtown in Toronto earlier in the trip and the room was at least 50 % bigger and 50 % cheaper than the Argonaut .
Facilities are nothing to write home about either . . .
the restaurant attached to the hotel The Blue Mermaid is quite nice , good food but not exactly easy on the pocket .
Small bar in the restaurant .
And I can not understand how people rave about the location . . .
sure you 're on Fisherman 's Wharf and there are a choice of restaurants but it is unbelievably tacky with so many souvenir shops and beggars in the immediate vicinity .
All in all , a disappointment for what we paid .
Great !
I have stayed at the Chancellor on 2 occasions , the last being Feb 2006 .
I would like to say that I think this hotel is really good .
The rooms are kept very clean , nice and bright , beds are comfortable too .
This hotel enjoys a great location on Union Square for everything .
Very convenient to catch the cable car too .
Yes this hotel is old and in my opinion its kept very well by all the staff .
The breakfast is excellent in the restaraunt and I can particularly recommend the daily fruit shakes !
waiter was also very friendly .
There is really only one thing that was slightly annoying . . on my second visit there , after checking in we went to our room and after 45 mins our luggage did not arrive !
I called the front desk and was told they were on their way . . . after a further 30 mins I went down to reception only to find them in the same spot that I left them , right by the front desk so I took them up to the room myself .
A minor point I agree , however it was pouring with rain in San Francisco so we were wet and really needed a change of clothes , otherwise I would not have minded this but there was no apology given whatsoever .
Besides this , I would have no hesitation in staying here again on my future visits to SFO .
Thanks . . .
manager and staff do a great job - keep it up !
Loved the hotel , service sucked !
While the hotel itself was nice , if not bit pricey , the service was not .
There was a conference while we were there and a disco had been set up right below our room for the conference attendees .
The floor was shaking the music was so loud .
As the hotel was oversold we could n't be moved and the only thing they offered to do for us was pay for a cab to another hotel , no offer of rooms elsewhere or anything .
Oh . . . we did get a free overpriced breakfast out of it .
Do n't eat in the dining room , way overpriced for what you get . . . $ 25 for Bacon and Eggs ?
Would not stay there again , not for the amount we paid and the service we got .
Stay here if you 're old and boring .
They allow dogs , which is nice .
But we had to sneak ours past the front desk , because their pet fee is astronomical .
The staff was alright , but this hotel is for old people .
Great Location - Hotel room good also .
This hotel is very centrally located near the Wharf and that is probably it 's best selling point .
The hotel itself is what you would expect from a Best Western - clean , comfortable with all the amenities .
The room size was okay - we got 2 double bed , however , would have preferred a room with one king bed but they had none available .
The restaurant next door was fine also - however , on the 2nd morning we went down for breakfast at 10 . 30 and they had stopped serving which I thought was a little early .
Overall an average hotel in a great location
Most disappointing hotel in SF .
This hotel is one of the most disappointing hotels in San Francisco and an absolute embarassment to the Renaissance brand .
I have traveled to San Francisco more than 100 times over the last five years and sampled just about every major upscale hotel in the area .
I would stay anywhere but this place .
The disappointment begins with the area that the hotel is located in , which , although centrally located , is the seediest part of the city and abounds in threatening looking characters .
I felt at risk just stepping out of the hotel !
The overall ambience within the hotel is gaudy early - eighties and an absolute assault to the eyes and senses .
Rooms are small , even by San Francisco standards , and missing the nice balconies that hotels like Hilton and Meridien have .
The overall feeling is of clutter and claustrophobia , exacerbated by windows that do n't open adequately and leaflets touting all manner of hotel services .
The beds are comfortable but nothing unique to the upgraded beds available at almost all major chains today .
By the way , almost every pictures on the hotel website is highly unrepresentative of reality .
Hotel infrastructure is in need of serious upgrading .
Heating and air - conditioning system is ineffective and noisy .
Water pressure is weak and hot and cold water mixing is problematic leading to uncomfortable showers and shaving .
To cap it all , the hotel charges a usurious rate for internet service and only offer service from noon - to - noon regardless of when you check - in and check - out .
Bathrooms have a dated feel and look .
And there are marks on the wall of amenities that were once attached to walls and are now gone .
Hotel staff service levels are nothing special and a little below average .
The concierge lounge is absolutely below standards of typical hotel properties and closed on weekends unlike most other major upscale hotels in downtown SF .
Overall , the quality and feel of this hotel is a better fit for Fairfield Inn than Marriott 's top - of - the - line Renaissance brand .
Only worth a stay if you can get it a Fairfield prices - - i . e . , below US $ 60 .
Ok for one night but freezing bathroom !
Certainly a good position if you need car parking - but the rooms whilst clean and tidy are rather dark and uninviting .
in our case the shower / WC was long overdue a refit - rather grubby and VERY COLD - absolutely no heating at all - the owners are very nice and helpful .
As we used it to stay overnight after a long flight it was ok but I would not want to spend much time here .
Also very pricey for what you got - staying in a Marriott the following two nights was cheaper and luxurious in comparison .
Avoid at all cost .
We arrived at the hotel 2 / 7 / 2006 unfortunately at midnight because our flight was delayed .
I was to attend a conference the next day .
A non - smoking room as reserved was not available .
When we arrived at the only room available at 12:30 AM the cleaning staff were in the room spraying it down with lysol and air refreshiner .
The room reaked of ciagarette smoke which worsened if you turned on the fan or heat .
Although I applaud them for their efforts , the combination was noxious .
At 1:30AM the fire alarm in the room went off .
After over an hour of deliberation with the front desk , security , and maintenace staff we finally got a non - smoking room at 2:30 AM .
After the inconvenience of a delayed flight the inconvenience at the hotel was rather unwelcome and made my trip to SanFran rather unproductive .
For $ 242 plus tax per night I would avoid this place like the plague .
I had intended to write a letter to corporate but was told the hotel is no longer under management with Marriot and is in limbo with regard to management .
Things are becoming a little more clear . . . .
Right position to visit SFO .
The hotel is in the right position to visit the city .
The price is really convenient .
Remember to ask for having a courtyard room . . .
the risk is to have a room in the street .
Just OK .
We stayed here for 4 nights May 24 - 27 We booked on the basis of the reviews here and were a little disappointed .
Positives . It 's in a good location by Fisherman 's Wharf / Pier 39 . It 's a good base for exploring and near the cable car stops . Complimentatry coffee / tea in the morning and wine / beer in the evening . Free Wireless internet access . Staff courteous and helpful . Price .
Negatives Small room - Not enough storage room if you had suitcases . Noisy A/C - I mentioned this and it was made quieter but still unusable for more than a few minutes at a time because of the noise .
Housekeeping - We returned one evening and the bed appeared to have been made but when the sheets were pulled back the mattress was exposed .
Also the sheets had holes .
Room generally had a tired feel .
This is a good base if that 's all you are using it for but do n't expect too much .
PS we did the Segway tour and it was excellent - highly recommended !
Ok for the price . . .
Booked two rooms on Priceline for $ 139 each , just an overnight stay while flying home the next morning .
Check in was good , rooms both ready , and we upgraded with no problems .
Room was very small for 4 , we apparently had an outside room , because trucks crashed around all night loading and unloading .
Tried to tip the maids for 2 extra towels as there were 4 of us and it was a HUGE problem , apparently no more than 4 towels per room ?
Did n't want to pay for the mini - bar , but frig leaked all over floor .
When maintenance guy came in , he blamed us for turning it down , it was in a locked cabinet !
Asked for a wake up call and did not get it .
One male working the desk the morning of 10 / 20 was rushed , rude , so checked out without talking to them .
Hotel is clean , very convenient to the Wharf and shopping .
Would not stay here again , due to noise and staff , but ok for the price , if I would have paid rack rate , I would have been more upset .
Great location , nice friendly staff .
We tried for the Packing Package when we booked online but it was not being offered .
When we called the hotel directly and mentioned we had stayed there before they were very nice and gave us the package .
They also try very hard to give you a quiet room if you request it .
It 's an older hotel and the rooms are clean and average size for the Union Square neighborhood .
If you like being in the heart of it , the location is great and in a very safe area .
The staff is friendly .
The parking is either valet ( an additional cost ) or park yourself at a garage around the corner .
We chose the park yourself and the advantage of retrieving your car quickly is a plus in our book .
There are times in the past at other hotels that we have waited up to an half hour for our car .
We would definitely stay there again .
Poor Experience .
I stayed here for 3 nights in July 07 for a business trip so a little late in posting feedback but thought I should still contribute .
OVERALLI completely failed to see why this hotel is rated so highly .
The location and checkin were good but everything else from the lobby , room and broadband were poor .
I can not recommend this hotel especially with other good options nearby .
In particular , the Mandarin Oriental is nearby and is often priced competitively which means you 'll be paying similar money to the Omni but for a VASTLY superior hotel .
Let me emphasize that I do not feel the Omni is bad .
The problem is that it is just ok and that there are options .
GOOD Fast checkin .
Pleasant staff .
Decent location .
BAD Small room .
Front lobby unimpressive .
Broadband speeds slow .
Diamond in the Ruff .
The chancelor is ideally located , seconds away from Union Square , and you can catch the trolley to take you to the trains / MUNI or just walk it , its just blocks away .
The rooms are beautiful and cozy .
The staff is amazingly helpful and accomadating .
The weather in SF makes it unnecessary for AC , an open window was just enough for us . . . and we 're from TX where AC is absolutely necessary !
H I G H L Y Recommended .
My partner and I stayed at the The Chancellor Hotel on Union Square from 6 / 30 / 07 to 7 / 4 / 07 .
It was our first time in San Francisco and the staff was excellent .
You can not beat the location as it is centrally locating to everything .
Will definitely consider it for our next trip to San Francisco .
Great Hotel Great Price Wow .
What a hotel .
We stayed 1 day pre cruise 2 days post cruise and would definitely stay here again .
Loved the nautical theme of the hotel and rooms .
Great location and wonderful bed and pillows .
Staff was exceptional and ca n't wait to go back again .
Thought on the Argonaut .
I had to be in San Francisco for work on Monday so flew out the Friday before .
It seemed obvious to look for somewhere at Fisherman 's Wharf and I was very impressed that the Argonaut had rooms available for only $ 150 a night .
It took a while for work to confirm the meeting , by that time I realised that Fisherman 's Wharf is full of burger bars and t - shirt shops and the price had risen to $ 250 .
But it still seemed a good place to be based so I booked it .
Was it worth it ?
Fisherman 's Wharf was dire but the hotel is the very last building on the row - there is a park across the street and you can get up early and walk all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge .
In the park is the cable car terminus for the spectacular ride across town and a short walk in the other direction is the historic tramcar that runs all the way along the wharf and also into town .
On the plus side , the rooms are large , the building may be in a former cannery but you certainly do n't feel like a tinned peach , the furnishings are new , it is impeccably clean and the staff are friendly and helpful .
There is a strong nautical theme , a little tiresome , but at least it gives the hotel some character , I ca n't imagine there is anywhere else like it . But . . . .
Although the room I was shown was on the 2nd floor ( ie one above ground ) it had a window straight on to the street , as the ground slopes back from the hotel .
I was able to move , without a problem , to a room at the side , overlooking a courtyard .
That was exceptionally noisy all evening ( just of a flight from London all I wanted to do was sleep ) and the next day a horrific singer was performing by noon and when I came back at 6 there was someone else , equally bad , there .
So I moved again .
I was warned about the lack of a view ( though only very few rooms would actually have a view of the water ) and of street noise was what I wanted - and as the lightwell is huge , the room was still bright and the silence was golden .
Where the Argonaut really crashed upon the rocks though was with the miserable restaurant . It was expensive and service was foul , breakfast was a plate of hard bacon and potato pieces together with an egg .
When I asked the waiter whether it was meant to be chilled , I was totally ignored .
I asked again and there was a grunt , yes , I think ( it was quite clear that he really could n't care less ) .
Someone at work had stayed there before and said that while they would n't stay there again , it was n't so bad that I should cancel .
I think that was right .
It was fine , there were many plus points but the bad ones were such that I probably would n't go back .
Though for $ 150 maybe I could be persuaded !
Truely a home away from home .
My husband and I chose this hotel 11 / 06 for a pre - cruise accomodation since it is only 25 min from the SF airport and 10 min from the cruise port .
We also had easy access to Fisherman 's Wharf , 10 min from Chinatown and in the heart of downtown SF .
Our visit proved to be quite memorable and the hotel exceeded our expectations .
We chose to book again 2 / 07 with our very picky relatives .
Initially , we were skeptical since the hotel was an older building , smaller rooms and not a big chain hotel , which they were use to .
Again , the hotel met ALL expectations .
My relatives commented : this hotel had character and charm , the room size was of little importance since it had the necessities of making it a comfortable stay , the staff was extremely helpful with booking our dinner reservations with a VIP card , booking our SF city tour at a reduced rate and being available when needed .
If you want something different than the normal hotel chain room and service . . . . this is the place to stay .
YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR HOME AWAY FROM HOME . . . .
Wonderful - - - NOT !
We 're sitting in our hotel room , waiting for another set of towels ( there are three of us and we were given towels for two ) .
The ice machine is empty .
The vending machine does n't work .
The concierge does not answer the phone .
Exactly who runs this place ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? !
Great location but disappointed with accommodation .
We recently stayed at Nob Hill Motor Inn ( based on previous reviews in tripadvisor and expedia ) and were greeted by Frank , who recommended Milano 's restaurant on Pacific Ave for dinner on our first night in San Francisco . (
Great Italian food by the way , we went there twice ! ! ) .
We stayed on the first floor ( the Inn only has 2 floors ) which is above the parking area and yes the free parking is great but spaces are tight for minivans .
The room 's decor was outdated , beds were lumpy and uncomfortable ( kids complained of back aches in the morning ) and there was an odor that lasted the duration of our stay .
So practically every day we had to leave the door open to air out the room .
The room had a small tv in the living room / bedroom , definitely deserves a larger tv .
The bathroom 's decor was also outdated and the floor was uneven .
We were often awakened by early risers due to very thin walls and ceilings and quite often heard doors slamming from other rooms .
The complimentary breakfast which we took advantage of for 2 mornings consisted of a few bananas , apples , muffins and danishes in plastic wrap along with coffee , tea , hot chocolate and orange juice which was served in there reception area which is in their tiny office .
We also recommend Polker 's for breakfast .
We found the location to be excellent ie based in Russian Hill area , close to Cow Hollow / Union Street Shops , Crookedest Street , Fisherman 's Wharf , Ghirardelli Square and within driving distances to Union Square , Chinatown , North Beach .
Unfortunately , the hotel owner 's recommendation to take a tour with Tower 's Tours did not go well for us .
The driver spoke very quickly and stops at Twin Peaks , The Golden Gate Bridge and Park were brief and we did n't even know the tour had started in Fisherman 's Wharf area .
Plus my daughter fell asleep on the tour ( that says alot ) .
It did n't help that the day was overcast and yes the temperature fluctuates in San Francisco and it is important to always have a sweater or jacket with you because the evenings get pretty chilling .
We loved visiting San Francisco and hope to return one day but we would not stay at the Nob Hill Motor Inn again .
We would probably pay more and stay somewhere else .
Fantastic base for exploring San Francisco .
My wife and I stayed in ten hotels during a two - week trip around California , Nevada and Arizona and the Castle Inn gave the best value for money .
Ideally placed for exploring San Francisco , the staff were really friendly and helpful , making us feel very welcome after a lengthy drive .
The room was clean and comfortable and we thought the breakfast was good - especially when compared with most of the others we experienced .
Of course the parking was a great advantage - we parked up and never thought about the car for the duration of our stay .
We could hear traffic , but what do you expect in a city ? !
All in all , we can highly recommend the Castle Inn .
Great Service , Great Price , Great Hotel .
This hotel was a great experience for us .
We stayed in San Francisco for 5 nights .
The hotel is right next to Union square and the cable cars - not a problem with noise .
My fiance and I slept prefectly throughout the night .
The bath tubs are huge and perfect for a relaxing bath after a long day .
The front desk staff and bellmen were fantastic with directions and places to go , along with restaurant recommendations .
There is free coffee and cookies , which were both delicious .
This was a great hotel at an extremely affordable price when booked on expedia .
I recommend this hotel to everyone ! ! !
Plain Vanilla , Overated .
The room itself was OK , but here are the downsides : typical deceptive pricing : get them in the door with a cheap quote , and then charge extra once you got them : Internet ( per computer ) $ 5 Aquafina water , $ 50 per night parking ( the attendant lied at check - in about neighboring options .
Unfriendly service at check - in and concierge desk .
Just completely uninspired .
OK value , if you expect 3 star hotel in good location .
Still suffering .
Had to check in 3 times , staff were unable to competently check people in to rooms , heard at least 2 people complain that the valet had lost their car and then we were double charged for the room .
When hotel was contacted they claimed I had not been charged even though I could show them it on my statement ! !
Then claimed I had said ok to a $ 20 fee for a room with a view even though I never had .
This has been on going and they still have not resolved it .
If you dont like your money , your car or good customer service , this is the place to go , otherwise stay in one of the nearby hotels . They are nicer , just as cheap and dont ruin your trip .
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST !
If you 're looking for something fancy schmancy with a swimming pool and fitness center , forget the Nob Hill Motel on Pacific Ave .
But , if you 're looking for sparkling rooms in a great neighborhood , AAA approved , reasonable , quiet , safe , free parking , continental breakfast , fantastic owners that were extremely helpful , free pick up for tours , three blocks from cable cars , one block from buses , great restaurants in three block area , Shanghai Kelly 's bar , etc . , then this is for you ! !
We stayed there 7 nights and would stay there again , without a doubt .
By the way , while visiting SF , MAKE SURE you see Beach Blanket Babylon ( see their website ) and get tix in advance .
Also bike the Golden Gate Bridge into Sausalito , take the early EVENING tour of Alcatraz and purchase a MUNI pass ( good on cable cars , buses , trolleys ) ; do n't miss visiting Fortune Cookie Factory in Chinatown , DeYoung Museum in GG Park , Muir Woods / Wine Country tour , and spend hours enjoying the sea lions at Fisherman 's Wharf .
What a great city - - wear comfortable shoes ! ! !
Lovely Hotel , Excellent Service .
From the moment we arrived from the UK to the moment we left the staff went out of their way to please us .
Walking into the grand lobby everything had an air of professionalism and efficiency .
Our room was on the 17th floor with a wonderful view out across to the bay .
With this standard of hotel you can expect to find the usual bathrobes and nice arrangement of toiletries , turn down service was provided each night along with the next day 's weather report , which was a nice idea .
The extra touches made you feel that this was a hotel that really cared for their guests .
Within a short walk from the hotel were a number of restaurants , shops and cafes around Union square .
We enjoyed staying just outside of the main tourist areas however being close enough to easily walk around to places .
We will definitely stay again when we visit San Francisco in the future .
Excellent Experience .
We were only there for one night , but it was fantastic .
The staff were very helpful , the hotel was in a great location , and it was very well appointed .
The beds were so comfortable , I did n't want to get up .
Highly recommend .
DIsappointed in Front Desk Staff and Room Size .
We were anticipating a special stay for our anniversary trip .
The front desk staff could n't even be bothered to greet us hello .
She took our confirmation information and was annoyed that we did n't have an additional copy to give her .
The room was clean and nicely decorated but very small .
The view from our 4th floor window was of two outside building walls , but it was very quiet .
My husband talked with the concierge , who he found very helpful .
The daily coffee and newspaper in the lobby were nice to have in the early morning .
The location is great , only a few blocks from the Wharf .
When we checked - out , the front desk clerk did n't even bother to ask about our stay , which is very unusual .
Fortunately , the hotel we stayed at in Monteray more than made up for our disappointing experience at this hotel .
Great location , but bring your earplugs . . . .
We stayed at the Argonaut for a weekend in August 2007 .
We selected the Argonaut for its location right on the water in Fisherman 's Wharf .
The hotel is in a great location - - it is on the edge of the Fisherman 's Wharf area and it is close to cable car , streetcar and bus stops .
Our room was large and very clean .
The nautical decorations are tasteful .
The biggest problem that we had with this hotel was the thin walls .
We heard our neighbor 's television and laughter late into the night .
Another issue that we had was with the bellhops .
On Friday afternoon when we arrived , we wanted to take a cab .
There were three parties waiting for a cab in front of the hotel , and the bellhop was having difficulty in finding cabs for us .
Instead of calling a cab company to get some cabs or making some suggestions for public transportation , he told us to walk a few blocks south and we should have better luck finding a cab .
It took us a sweaty half - hour to find a cab - - it was not a great way to start our trip !
We relied solely on public transportation after that experience , however , and were fine .
Our room had a Golden Gate view .
I would not recommend paying extra for the view .
The weather was foggy in the morning , and the window is not conveniently located for enjoying the view while relaxing in the room .
I do n't think that you would miss anything by not having the view .
In short , the location and appearance of the hotel were excellent , but the thin walls and the lack of assistance with transportation will keep us from staying here in the future .
AVoid at all costs .
My sister reserved a suite of rooms for guests for her wedding .
We booked one of these rooms more than a month in advance , then called to reconfirm several weeks before .
We got email confirmations both times .
When we arrived at the hotel they said sorry , we have your reservation but we have no room .
This was late at night and I have an eight year old son .
They agreed to put us up at another hotel , but were unpleasant an unaccomodating .
And , the two rooms my sister in law had booked for her children were also not available and she had talked to them three times beforehand .
So she and my brother had a room , but their teenage children did not and we were completely separated in a hotel across town away from the wedding party .
If you do n't mind booking way in advance , getting several confirmaitions and then being shuffled off to some other hotel this is the hotel for you .
Otherwise stay away .
A Golden Experience ( no fleece ! ) at the Argonaut .
From the dapper attire on the doorman to the professional yet personal attention from the bellhop , we were immediately impressed with the Argonaut .
And then we saw the room !
We had a very spacious room on the 2nd floor , overlooking the lively courtyard , with an exposed brick wall and windows that open - - not to mention a marvelously comfortable bed and bedding .
Prime location for strolling along the pier ( do n't miss the Maritime Museum ! ) , to Ghirardelli Square - - and only a block to the cable car , two to the F Line Streetcar that goes all the way to the Ferry Terminal building , then on to the Castro neighborhood .
Enjoyed talking to fellow travelers during the evening wine reception in the lobby , breakfasts at the Blue Mermaid - - but be sure to visit the Buena Vista - - across the street from the Argonaut - - for an Irish Coffee with your eggs !
Spent a week there in September and ca n't wait to return !
Nice hotel .
This is the second time I have stayed at the Tuscan Inn .
Hotel is nice and clean , in a very convenient location , and the staff is friendly and helpful .
Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .
I will stay again next time I am in San Francisco .
Very good value .
I recently stayed at the Castle Inn and it was very good quality .
Very friendly and helpful front desk .
The rooms were very clean and the maid service was very efficient .
Free breakfast was a nice touch .
The area around the hotel is not bad , there are a few bars and restaurants .
I can recommend the Chinese place around the corner ( not the Thai place ) , it does n't look much but the food was absolutely top quality .
Within walking distance are 2 cable car lines , Lombard street and fishermans Wharf .
Quality .
Great hotel .
The service in the hotel was really good .
The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .
The location was also right next to Fisherman 's Wharf and a 3 minute walk to the cable car .
Would definitely stay here again .
It was great !
The hotel was lovely and the staff was outstanding .
Every part of our stay here was pleasant .
We arrived earlier than expected ( nearly 2 hours before we were scheduled to check in ) and they had our room ready for us anyway .
They took our bags to our room and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay .
After unpacking we realized the comforter and pillows were down and we 're both allergic to down .
I called the front desk and asked for non - down blankets and pillows .
Not five minutes later they were at our door .
The room was very nice - very clean and had all the ammenitites we could ask for .
We thouroughly enjoyed our stay at the Orchard Hotel and will be staying there later this year when we return to SF .
happy and satisfied .
I booked the evening for my girlfriend and I to stay on a wednesday night in the city .
She arrived earlier and had no problems checking in .
The location was great , right across the street from the Sir Francis Drake Hotel .
The booking staff was efficient .
The concierge was n't too helpful , and looked at me funny when I asked if anything ' special ' was going on in the city during the evening .
Our room was reasonably sized for san francisco .
It was on the fourth floor and we used both the elevator and the stairs .
I requested a quiet room which was an option on the hotel website .
We did n't have any problems with noise .
The bed , TV , bathroom were all fine .
There were a bunch of coupons in our room for discounts at retailers and also for discounts at the hotel bar .
So , we went down to the hotel bar and had a couple of drinks , which were good .
We went over to the Starlight Room on top of the Sir Francis Drake hotel during the evening , which was fun .
On the whole , it was a pleasant experience and a great location to hang out from .
I can imagine a better hotel experience , but I 'm not sure I 'd risk a worse one by straying from this hotel the next time we go to to the city .
Good location - and that 's it .
A complete disappointment - from losing the reservation made through Best Western toll - free number ( our computer crashed when receiving reservations from BW - lame ) to charging our credit card for someone elses stay 3 WEEKS AFTER WE LEFT !
There appears to be no management actively involved with running this dump , cause when we asked to speak with one the front desk staff got very nervous and suddenly worked hard to find our lost reservation .
Dont let the free wine and biscotti fool you .
There is a Holiday Inn Express exactly one block away .
Basic and disappointing .
Basic and disappointing .
The photo is misleading , we thought .
The layout is unattractive , as the car - park is the whole ground - floor and also serves as the entrance !
The reception is a tiny office and the rooms are on narrow internal balconies overlooking the centre of the carpark .
We could not understand glowing reviews by earlier visitors .
Staff at the front - desk were quite friendly but when the toilet became blocked the room staff did not hurry to help .
Breakfast was awful .
At least it was quite clean , and it does seem hard to get a moderately priced place in SanFrancisco in Summer .
It is near to the overrated cablecars , and we enjoyed a boat trip in the harbour ( but watch out for sunburn even in the mist ) .
We would try somewhere else if there is a next time in San Francisco .
Great location , bad management .
This hotel , recently liberated from the Marriot chain , heavily promoted itself on Expedia .
For something special , my husband and I treated my mom to a 60th birthday trip in San Francisco .
I wanted a special hotel , but could not afford the W .
The price was right for this place , the location was EXCELLENT - around the corner from the cable car , across the street from the BART station and the big , new Westfield shopping center , and a few blocks from Union square .
The room was clean , the beds were comfortable - soft pillows , feather comfortors .
I even had room service bring tea - a charming Chinese gentleman delivered it with new years wishes and lots of giggles .
BUT - and this is the big BUT - we were not given our room until 2AM ! ! ! ! ! ! !
We checked in at 9 PM .
Fortunately , my mom and I checked in the day before , so we were able to put our 2 young sons to bed in her room .
My husband and I waited 5 hours in the lobby , mostly standing in line with about 25 other very hostile guests , waiting for our room .
There was a couple who had spent 25 hours traveling from Caracas , VZ , a man with Parkinson 's disease who desperately needed rest , and a long list of other stories .
In addition to all of this , the hotel staff repeatedly double assigned rooms .
They would send a relieved guest up to a room , only to have them return to say someone was already in it ! ! !
Can you imagine how mortifyingly embarrassing that must have been for both parties ? ? ? ?
This happened at least 4 times by my count .
When we were given our room assignment , we made the staff call the room before we went up .
The other part that was so awful was that we were told 3 times that our room would be ready in 30 minutes , and to come back .
It took at least 1 hour to get through the line .
My question is , why did n't the staff let people know what was going on ?
They knew the rooms would n't be ready , with only the small night cleaning staff and a number of very late check - outs ( Singapore Air has a regular contract , I guess ) .
Really unconscionable !
My husband refused the offer of a free breakfast ( hah ! ) and demanded the room for free - which is what we got .
If you want to stay in this hotel , you are rolling the dice with your time and relaxation .
Horrible Experience with the Management .
My stay at the Omni San Francisco started out poorly when I requested a double room ( with two double beds ) but received a queen room ( with one queen ) .
I asked for a rollaway bed , and ages later received a ridiculous inflatable bed not suitable for a comfortable night 's sleep . I managed , but it was very uncomfortable .
The worst part , however , came after my stay when I had a $ 300 charge on my credit card .
I called to inquire about the charge and they proceeded to tell me it was for room damage .
I had no idea what they were talking about and after further investigation , they told me there was a hole in the wall of the room we stayed in .
I of course asked for the manager to call me , and was extremely taken aback at how I was treated . He was pompous and rude and immediately accused me of putting the hole in the wall .
He assured me there was no way his staff would have missed the hole and rented out a room in such a state .
I told him that they did , and that my friend ( who I immediately phoned afterwards ) actually saw the hole but forgot to mention it to me ( it was at the bottom of the wall near the baseboard in the hallway near the door , making it easy to miss ) .
After I relayed this to the manager , he made a snide remark about how guests of his hotel are high - class and would call and complain if they received a room with a hole in the wall .
Having no idea of the consequences of not reporting the hole , my friend did n't feel he needed to say anything and thus I never knew about it .
The manager was horribly condescending and from his last remark implied that I was not a high - class guest and " did n't belong " at his hotel .
I again assured him that the hole was not from me and he had no proof .
He again insisted that his staff does not make mistakes and would never rent out a room with a hole in the wall .
I was not going to budge and insisted that he reverse the charge .
After going back and forth for awhile , he finally succumbed and reversed the charge .
However , I was left with a bad taste in my mouth .
I should not have had to defend my honor , and I knew he thought I was lying even after he reversed the charge .
Even though I got the charge reversed , I still did n't feel like I won .
This hotel should not be four - star , as four - star hotels would never treat their guests like this .
The Omni San Francisco is a third - rate hotel with mediocre customer service and horrible management .
Yes , it was bad luck that I got that room , but my experience with the management was enough to make me write this review and encourage travelers to stay somewhere else .
Health Risk - Unsanitary Conditions .
After seeing news stories about hotels not washing the drinking glasses in the rooms , I decided to mark the glass to see if it was exchanged .
The next day after the room was made up the maid neatly placed the glasses on the vanity with protective tops placed over them .
When I checked , sure enough the mark I had placed proved the glasses had not been washed .
I notified the hotel manager and she sent security to take a report .
That was the last I heard from the hotel manager , so evidently the Parc 55 is not to concerned with Health Department regulations .
I guess they got mad that I complained because the next day the room was not made up at all .
Finally at 5:00pm a maid knocked on the door and asked if we wanted the room cleaned .
I did n't bother to complain just wo n't stay here again .
This hotel is not a 4 star as advertised .
Great start to our holiday .
We had a great four night stay at the Argonaut .
Our rooms were large , clean and well decorated / furnished .
The location is very convenient .
The free wine hour is also a bonus - but a little early at 5 - 6pm .
We had booked our rooms through an independent travel agent , requesting two double beds in each room .
When we arrived we were given rooms with one king - sized bed in each , but these were changed without any problem after our first night .
The desk staff were helpful about this .
All the staff were fine , the bell boys were particularly friendly .
We did n't notice any noise , and we were lucky with the weather .
I would certainly recommend this hotel .
Horrific .
Parc 55 used to be great , not anymore . . .
Stayed at the Parc55 because it *used* to be a good hotel , back when I lived in SF , and I had had good experiences there .
Got a discounted rate through their web site , so I switched to there instead of at a host hotel for the convention I was attending .
What a mistake !
They nickel - and - dime you to DEATH , and by the time we were through paying dribs and drabs for things , it was more expensive than the other hotel anyway .
Do n't get me started on the $ 40 Valet charge - - better hotels in San Fran have $ 25 or 30 or so .
We , also , parked at the 5th and Mission garage after check - in , which is a couple blocks away , a STEAL at $ 16 / day maximum , and was more convenient to our convention anyhow .
Complimentary breakfast for concierge - level rooms was NOT worth it .
No hot food , and the lunch meats they did have , looked scary and gross . ( A Hampton Inn breakfast is a Lucullan feast next to this place . )
Wireless charge was ASTRONOMICAL .
Again , why free at the Hampton Inns , properties that are a fraction of the cost ?
I *like* staying at luxury hotels , but this is senseless .
The neighborhood of the hotel is dicey at best , loud , noisy , and full of bums .
You have to run a large gauntlet of panhandlers , con artists and questionable vendors just to get to the BART station and cable cars on the next block .
Worst of the Parc55 offenses by far however : We had returned the last night of our stay with a to - go box , but realized we did n't get utensils .
We rang housekeeping and asked for knives and forks , they said fine .
When they came up , they presented a BILL , for $ 4 for each utensil , AND tax ( ! ! ! ) on the bill , AND the 18 % room service delivery charge ! ! ! !
I am not kidding !
Over $ 10 to get a knife and fork !
THAT WAS IT !
I had a lot to say the next morning at check out - - they removed the tax and the delivery charge , but NOT the charges for the utensils ! ! ! CRAZY !
We should have just gone to the Walgreen 's down the street or even the 24 - hour Carls Jr on the next block . . .
Parc55 , never again !
I felt bad because I *cheated* on my mainstay Hotel Vitale , and that is a mistake which will not be repeated , I assure you !
Worst stay ever anywhere .
We arrived at the hotel at 4pm , and there were no towels in the room .
I was told they would send some up .
An hour later I was told they would send some up .
I was told this until 8pm , when I was told they were out of towels in the hotel until 9pm .
I had also reserved a room with 2 queen beds and got a room with 2 large twin beds , not even full sized where my wife and I could not sleep in one bed ( we are not that large either ) .
I had read a prior review complaning about the fact the hotel had run out of the free morning biscotti 's as promised to quests .
That did not happen to us .
They sliced the biscotti 's into 1 / 4 inch slices so all quests were assured to get a crumb , if they wanted ( no one was taking them ) I asked to speak to a manager the night we aRRIVED TO DISCUSS THE TOWELS .
i WAS TOLD NONE WERE AVAILABLE .
i asked again the next morning , and was once again told none were available that day .
I called again the next day upon returning home ( long distance at my expense ) and kept getting looped to the 800 central reservations numver .
When I asked one of those people if I could speak to a manager or supervisor I was told none were available to talk to customers .
I left home at 5am the night of my stay and paid extra to get what we thought was going to be a nice room in the central warf area of the city the night before taking our son to Stanford for summer school and have a night on the town .
After driving all day , and not only not being able to take a shower until after 9pm ( arriving at 4pm ) but being lied to every hour and forced to wait for towels based upon these lies , our night on the town was reduced to waiting in a very small , dingy hotel room with beds we could not all even sleep on .
My wife and son rotated trying to sleep on a small chair .
I have never in my life stayed at a hotel , especially one this expensive that did not even have towels for their guests , lied about that and the bed sizes , and were so un - helpful witrh anything we needed .
There are plenty of other hotelsd in this area , any of them have to be better than this was .
Nice hotel - wo n't be going again though .
The hotel was nicely decorated and so too were the rooms .
Initially , a new receptionist mistakenly gave us a smoking room but the very capable and pleasant assistant general manager Laura rectified this problem the next day .
The second room we had was really noisy because the inconsiderate people in the next room continually had their loud air - conditioning units on all day and all night .
Someone attempted to get into our room at 4:20am on night and fortunately we had our deadbolt and chain on the door .
This kind of security issue must be a regular problem because there is a rather large section on safety security in the room directory and warnings on the card that they give you with your key cards in .
Following the hotels guidance about dealing with a security issue , we reported the incident immediately with the front desk .
The gentleman who answered spoke little English and clearly did n't really understand what we were trying to say .
My husband gave up and wedged two suitcases and a chair in front of the door too .
The area ( Fisherman 's Wharf ) can be unsafe at times .
We spotted the usual pick - pocketers / bag snatchers hanging around the crossings in the area early evening time .
They work in teams waiting for you to be distracted waiting for the walking man signal .
If go to this area always be extra vigilant , also with street performers , again they are a distraction to you .
We used to love San Francisco but we 've decided we wo n't be going again .
We were there for four nights / three full days and beggars must have asked us for money at least 100 times ( I 'm not exaggerating ) , it 's bad .
Not the greatest .
Stayed here for honeymoon .
On first impressions every thing seemed ok . . . .
but there were a few problems : LOCATION : Its great for cable car and during the day the area of fisherman 's wharf is buzzing with activity , however at night the area is quite seedy . .
Hooters is up the street , there are numerous homeless people begging and harrassing passersby ( watch out for the one who hides behind a bunch of leaves , and jumps out on people . . and gets tips for this ) , numerous youths drinking and cruising in their vintage cars starting fights with each other .
ROOMS : Bit tacky but good fun . .
Cheetah robes , fishing equipment .
Have to agree walls are paper thin , and could hear next door 's arguements !
SERVICE : Not bad , although porter promised since we were on honeymoon we 'd have a bottle of champagne in our room . . .
He then accepted our generous tip , and never materialised with the goods .
RESTAURANT : Only went for breakfast , which was again ok . Not much choice .
Beware though , we had our bag stolen during breakfast , staff were helpful but we 've never heard anything since .
FAMILIES : We did over hear a lady at reception claiming she feared for her children in the area , and asked staff was it safe .
The hotel was n't really geared for families esp with the wine evenings in reception . . . . they looked like a bunch of old men and women seeing how much free drink they could get .
All in all our stay was ok , we 'd go shopping in Union Square , went to Alcatraz day trip and liked to spent as much time away from the hotel .
I would n't stay in the Argonaut again , nor recommend to my family .
Central hotel in San Francisco .
Excellent location in down town San Francisco , right next to Market Street and where cable cars run from .
Only issue is noise of police sirens at night : kept us awake despite being on 20th floor , maybe we were unlucky .
Children really liked breakfasts there , though quite pricey .
Rooms have everything you 'd need given you are staying in a downtown location Simon
Great hotel .
This hotel is just excellent ! !
Location is perfect , the rooms were nice and clean .
And the hotel staff is so friendly and helpful .
I was really impressed about how service minded they were !
My friends and I stayed for 4 nights and had nothing to complain about .
I will definately book Chancellor for my next stay in SF ! : )
beautiful room , great location .
Our room was beautiful , the bed was comfortable , and the staff was friendly and always helpful .
The location was ideal .
The Chinatown gate was a block away , the cable cars go right by , and there are several good restaurants nearby .
Just ok , Front Desk needs retraining .
Requested a high corner room in February through the hotel website for my August trip to San Francisco .
Front desk was unaccomodating upon check in .
Checked with them every day of my six night stay and they were not able to honor my request .
Staff with few exceptions seems cold and unapologetic .
Location A + ( get the muti - day Muni pass )
Staff D -
Customer service training needed
Room C - Clean but Average , AC did not work properly in room , bed ok but not wonderful , three oversized pillows useless
Extras C -
Business center will let your print a boarding pass for your return trip for free , anything else costs per page with internet access $ 10.00 for 20 minutes
Overall C -
Location is the key with this property .
Service is lacking and upgrades bring them to about the year 2000 .
Not impressed and will stay elsewhere next time .
Great value - Great location .
Trip Advisor led us to this hotel and we were very pleased with the ' recommendation ' .
This is a no frills place to stay but the staff are very friendly and the location is great .
Fisherman 's Wharf is within easy walking distance as are the bus and tram routes that can take you all over SF .
The hotel is situated in a bohemian part of town with lots of relaxed restaurants and coffee shops just round the corner .
The area felt very safe .
Staff were very helpful and helped to map out all the places to go - and not go !
Their advice was valuable .
The rooms were clean and adequate - we didnt spend much time in them . . . remember there are no ' communal ' type hotel facilities .
The Castle Inn is a great option for travellers who dont mind being slightly out of town but need to be somewhere safe within shooting distance of the attractions .
We would definitely recommend it .
Very nice place .
We spent 3 nights in the Castle Inn 's only suite .
It is not a fancy hotel but was perfect for four people ( two adults with two teenagers ) .
The suite is more like an apartment and has two good sized clean rooms each with a king sized bed .
There is a good sized bath and huge walk - in closet .
The larger of the rooms also had two sofas and two chairs .
The second room is off of a hallway - - good for privacy .
The suite has a small refrigerator with separate freezer , microwave , iron and board .
We used a roll - away in the larger room for one of the teenagers .
It was far better than the usual roll - away .
More like a twin bed on wheels .
The cost of the suite was far less than two separate rooms would have been and if we found two rooms at another hotel for what we paid for the suite , I am sure that they would not be nearly as nice .
The Castle Inn is located in the Russian Hill area of the city , a vibrant and convenient neighborhood with many varied restaurants within a few block walk .
We felt more like we were living like locals than staying at a hotel .
The free covered parking is a big plus .
Cable cars are nearby , only 21 / 2 blocks .
We bought 3 day city transportation passes at $ 18 each and used them a lot , a bargain particularly since the cable cars are otherwise $ 5 / ride .
Fisherman 's wharf was a pleasant walk and also a great cable car ride away .
Desk staff could not have been nicer or more helpful .
Altogether , the Casle Inn is a fine choice .
Loved the Argonaut - Very Romantic Growwwlllll ! !
Nice Place , but Loud Pipes .
Had a nice time at Hotel Rex - - mainly location was perfect .
However , the pipes or plumbing was so loud that there was a constant thumping going on whenever anyone used the sink above us .
Room was clean and the place was nice .
But I enjoyed some of the other Joie De VIvre hotels in the same two block area more .
Great Hotel .
Picked Omni from previous reviews . . .
Some may say being on edge of financial district is quiet , well No !
We experienced a Thursday , Friday and Saturday .
Saturday was very quiet to get going as most local deli 's etc within 10 min walk either do not open on Saturday or open later , say 10am which is fine .
It is only 10 min walk from Ferry Building which has many cafes etc and markets at the weekend .
Or just hop on cable car that goes past hotel and get off further up California Street to jump on cable car down to Union Square , 15 mins tops .
Loads of places to eat there .
The cable cars are great , get a $ 11 dollar all day ticket from hotal reception , valid for the cars and buses .
Rooms are lovely , nice and big and great bathrooms , all marble , rooms have air con big TV , video games etc .
We used as base to explore , Lombard street , G Gate bridge , Fishermans Wharf , Italian quarter , Coit Tower .
Most is easily walkable but those hills can be pretty steep so the cable cars really do make it easy .
One tip though . . . .
it can be better to go the end of the line / terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy and nobody gets off , hence you can wait at a stop and not get on at all .
Busiest route is from the Market to Fishermansd Wharf via Hyde Street .
This one passes over Lombard Street just by the ' crooked street ' bit .
Great fun standing on the side and leaning out . . . . which you are not supposed to do of course .
We did have one evening meal in the Bob 's Steakhouse , attached to hotel and one brealfast . Very good quality although a bit more expensive .
Very very busy during the week with business people etc .
The bar gets very crowded and noisy but in a nice happy , people enjoying themseleves sort of way .
All the staff were very polite and extremely helpful , whatever the question is .
Comfortable and good service .
My wife travels 20 weeks / year and stays in many hotels ranging from Best Western to Four Seasons .
We found this hotel to be very comfortable , the room was large , the staff that we encountered were VERY friendly and helpful , and the area was NOT any worse than any other very large city .
Yes there were homeless and the Tenderloin is n't far , but I felt no worse than I did in NYC or Phil or DC .
Union Square is just as close as any bad area so it really is n't threatening .
It 's just a city , man .
Why the high ratings for this place ?
Best Western website for this hotel advertised refrigerators in every room .
Because of some special food needs , we booked this hotel with this understanding , plus it had received highest rating - best hotel in Wharf area .
Were here July6 - 9 ( still here . . . unfortunately . . . . )
Got to hotel , disappointed in the incredibly small rooms , but location is great .
Website also said rooms had been recently redecorated - guess they forgot our 2 rooms - kind of shabby .
Cheap furniture .
Outdated outlets - could n't plug cell phone chargers in except one place under desk .
Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it 's holder when anyone used the door to our room .
Finally unplugged it and left it down on the TINY sink are space .
Worst part was no fridges in room as advertised .
They had quasi mini - bars in dorm - size fridges but we were told by front desk that we could not empty them out without being charged for the contents .
We asked to speak to a manager , but after an hour of waiting no one came to talk to us about this .
Wanted to get on with being tourists so we decided not to wait .
Asked next morning - still told we could n't empty them - offered to pull up website on our laptop which still showed that fridges came with rooms but they did n't want to see it - they just wanted to say that there rooms never had fridges and did n't know why BW advertised that they did .
They told me I would have to wait for maids to come to take stuff out of fridge later in the day - like i 'm really going to waste tourist time for this .
I BEGGED them to be able to just remove the things myself and leave them on the desk - they said they 'd have to talk to a manager - i said great when would they be in - they said they had no idea ! ! ! ! !
Totally unwilling to help us in any way .
WORST BW we 've ever stayed in as far as service goes .
Great handy hotel .
Booked this hotel after reading the Trip Advisor reviews , and glad I did .
Perfect location - few blocks up from main shopping area , three blocks from Chinatown , on main cable car route to Fishermans Wharf .
Pleasant , large room with a huge comfy bed .
The hotel website does n't mention air con , but it does have climate control so had no issues ( and I 'm fussy about this ! ) .
Handy breakfast buffet to get you started - coffee , bagels , pastries , juices and fresh fruit .
Door staff handy for getting taxis and booking shuttle back to the airport .
LOVED San Francisco , ca n't wait to go back and will stay here again .
Unprofessional .
It 's a real shame that the Argonaut is probably the nicest hotel I 've ever stayed at , but upon checkout we were charged an additional $ 21 . 00 for beer .
Apparently the cleaning staff noticed empty beer cans in the room and assumed that we had taken them out of the minibar , which we did n't open even once during our stay .
We bought beer at a local market and brought it back to our room .
We explained this to the staff when we checked out , and they told us that they would remove this bogus charge , but when I got my credit card bill , the charge was still there .
Most hotels have a better way of keeping up with what 's taken out of minibars .
My suggestion is that if you stay at the Argonaut and do n't plan to use the minibar , return your key to it immediately .
Do n't get caught in their trap .
I paid enough just to stay at this hotel , and to be charged even one penny extra is an insult .
But to be lied to by the hotel staff goes beyond thunderdome .
And a word to the cleaning staff : I left you a generous tip because I thought you did such a great job cleaning the room each day .
However , because of you , I will never leave a tip again in a hotel room , and believe me , I will never stay at the Argonaut again .
Great - Loved it !
Superb .
Lovely hotel and excellent location .
Rooms ( although I suppose small by US standards ) were cosy but had everything you wanted inc . heating ( yes in August ! ) and a clean bathroom .
We were fortunate enough to have a courtyard room which I gather is a better option .
Free coffee and biscotti in the morning is a nice touch but we never made it back in time for free beer and wine from 5 - 6pm .
The valet guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in / guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .
The concierge said we stood no chance of getting tickets to Alcatraz ( walked around the corner and found an agency selling them ) - perhap I should 've offered him a $ 20 tip ? !
Tip - book NOW for Alcatraz - www . bluegoldferries . com - for $ 16 pp rather than the inflated package costs of tour agencies .
We got stuck with our car hire overnight and paid $ 25 to park - bit steep as there is a car park next door for less than that - doh !
Overall though a top hotel in an excellent location .
Make sure you make the 15 - 20 min walk up Stockton Ave to Little Italy and do n't get totally distracted by Fishermans Wharf !
fantastic hotel , well located .
stayed at the Parc 55 in september during a business trip .
5minutes from union square and main shopping area .
hotel room was spacious clean and gave us clear views of the city .
Thai restaurant in the hotel served amazing thai food that was reasonably priced .
the sports bar was also a great place to eat and drink .
location of the hotel is really well placed - you 're in the middle of everything .
planning on coming back to SF next year for a vacation and will be sure to book my room at Parc 55 again .
perfect place to relax after a hard days work ( or shopping ; ) )
Very Nice Hotel .
After seeing this hotel during a tour on the cable car , we walked in to see if they had any rooms available for that night .
They told us they were completely booked and if they had any rooms , they were $ 229 per night .
We then went outside and used my husband 's phone to call Hotels . com .
They immediately booked us a room in this same hotel for only $ 119.00 .
It was a very nice hotel and a beautiful view of downtown San Francisco .
It 's not something I would do all the time but nice for one night .
Great place for Central SF .
Most travellers ' reviews were good for this hotel , which is why we chose it .
Our experience bears out the truth of these .
Whilst the rooms may be considered small by US standards , they are perfectly adequate , well furnished , and very clean .
There was more than enough space to move about easily , with comfortable chairs , as well as a desk .
The free wifi was particularly appreciated .
The huge walk - in closet for clothing and baggage , meant no clutter in the bedroom .
The hotel staff were wonderful ; very helpful and friendly .
Full marks to them for customer service .
We are horrendously light sleepers , and found the hum of a heating unit on a roof below ( we were on the 6th floor ) a bit disturbing as we like to sleep with the window open .
Because of this we asked if we could change our room , and this was done very quickly and without any problem .
A tip - if you want a really quiet room , ask for one at the back of the hotel above floor 10 .
We took breakfast every morning in the hotel 's restaurant , Luques .
Excellent food and service and great value .
Try the scrambled egg with greens !
We also liked their Protester breakfast - juice , coffee , fresh fruit cup and wholewheat toast - and there are other options .
We would definitely stay here again .
The only thing we would suggest as an improvement - and this goes for ALL US hotels - a means of boiling water in the rooms .
Coffee and tea in the lobby is not terribly convenient if , like us , you need an early morning cuppa to get going !
Andrew Amanda
noisy .
My husband and I was on our honeymoon and at first we were very pleased with our room and the room service and quality of food was excellent but the only thing was that we must have had children staying above us as all we could hear was a thumping noise as if they were running up and down the floor especially a night when we were trying to get to sleep , as a result we wont consider staying there again .
Everything appeared okay .
Stayed here recently .
Everything went well .
I really liked the place .
The hotel had been pre booked so on check out I had nothing else to pay .
However , when I returned home , I discovered the hotel had charged my credit card $ 1.63 without my knowledge the day after check out .
It is only a small sum of money but I was very concerned as I had not stolen anything from the hotel or used any of the stuff in the bedroom bar !
The hotel now claims however that items were removed .
The only others with access to this food and drink were the cleaning staff .
I suggest to anyone staying here to make sure they know what is being taken out of their credit card before they leave this hotel .
I am a very honest person who has stayed in many hotels over Europe and America and I have never before experienced an insult like this .
My credit card company are supportive and refunded my money but be aware .
There could have been a lot more money involved .
All I have is my word that I removed no items !
The Rex Hotel is the King .
Have stayed at the Rex many times and always found the staff friendly , capable and a pleasure to deal with .
Great location , on the edge of Union Square , theaters and Chinatown .
And no hills to climb !
The Rex is funky , fun and do n't miss the afternoon wine hour .
Special feature are the two suites on the top floor .
Can accomodate four guest as both the bedroom and living room are quite large .
And the suite contains 1 and 1 / 2 baths which certainly adds to the comfort .
The computer room has two computers , a printer and is rarely busy - and it 's all free .
Do n't Stay Here !
Every single staff member we spoke with at Parc 55 were incredibly RUDE and unaccomodating .
I was shocked at their behavior .
In addition , the rooms were not clean , and are in need of renovation / refurbishing .
I am a travel agent , so believe me when I say DO NOT stay at this hotel .
You can find a much better SF hotel for the price ( or less ! ) of a stay here , and you will avoid a very unpleasant experience .
Not Bad - Not Great .
We stayed here in early August as a family of 4 w / 15 12 year old kids on first trip to San Francisco .
The hotel is a bit outdated ; not rundown necessarily , just outdated .
We had a gorgeous suite with wraparound views on one of the upper floors .
The view was just stunning - - we could see the Golden Gate Bridge out the bedroom window and the Coit Tower out the Living Room window .
Service was fine ; restaurant was ok .
Nothing really outstanding ; just average .
This is probably a better business hotel than tourist place .
But if you get a great rate or use points , it is just fine .
The cable car was right there , there was lots of shopping .
It was not the best part of town but convenient enough .
Loved it !! .
I absolutely loved this hotel .
I was a bit concerned about the posts regarding the homeless but there are homeless throughout the city .
I stayed in a suite on the 30th floor with absolutely wonderful views of the city .
In addition , I had acess to the club upstairs for breakfast and desserts served after 7:30 PM .
Just a wonderful experience .
The staff was also very very nice .
Nice hotel , fantastic place , expansive parking .
We stayed at St . Francis for 5 nights .
We booked the hotel in Europe and the price is really okay if you book it at a traveller office in Europe and not online on there homepage .
You get much cheaper rates .
The hotel is directly on the union square .
It is easy to go to fishermans warf with the cable car , to walk to china town , italian town or coit tower .
Or simply go shopping to market street .
The room is a little bit small if you want to have only one bed for two .
The bathroom was old and not that nice .
It does not fit to the rest of the room .
We were for 3 weeks in the USA and San Francisco was our last stop .
We had a rental car and the bigest problem at the St . Francis for me was the expansive parking garage .
I think a hotel like the St . Francis should have a parking garage for free for there guests .
The garage for one day with in and out costs 44 Dollars .
Anyway the parking in San Fran is expansive but at the St . Francis its much more expansive .
So if you ever come by car to the St . Francis : Park at the Sutter - Stockten Garage .
It 's only a 3 minutes walk from the St . Francis and has cheaper rates .
This hotel has character and the wow factor !
Myself and my wife have just returned from a 5 day break in San Francisco and stayed at the Argonaut Hotel .
We picked the hotel based on it 's top 10 status on Trip Advisor .
We were not disappointed , this hotel has loads of character and is one of the best US hotels we have stayed in .
The location is surperb which all the previous reviews confirm .
It is just around the corner to the Hyde / Powell cable car turnaround point and only a short walk from the Hyde / Market cable car and also the streetcar service which goes right away to Castro .
The ferry piers are also within easy reach .
There is an abundance of restaurants / cafes / shops etc .
Definately try the fresh crab from anywhere on Fishermans Grotto and the fresh clam chowder in a bread bowl from the boudin bakery .
The check in was quick , painless and pleasant experience .
The hotel decor was nautical , modern , cosy and very well kept .
The room was like it hadnt been slept in before and was spotlessly clean .
We had an inside room with a view of an inner square .
The room was longer than wide but plenty of room for two with a lovely nautical theme and exposed beams left behind by its previous use as the Del Monte warehouse .
The room had a Sony Vega TV and DVD player , radio alarm clock and Aveda products in the bathrooms , umbrella in the wardrobe / closet ( which we needed one day ) and dont forget the quirky leopard print bathrobes .
Every night at 17:00 there is free wine provided of the monthly featured vineyard by the hotel manager and staff .
It can get a bit busy in the lobby and fire area during these times but it is good to mingle with fellow guest and staff to swap stories and tips .
All staff we came in contact with were friendly , helpful and always had something nice to say such as welcome back , Hope you had a nice day or Have a great day .
There was an asian girl who worked on the concierge desk who was n't rude or unhelpful but not has friendly looking as the others .
All in all this hotel is clean , efficient , quirky , cosy and has bags of character .
we will definately return to SF and when we do there is no doubt that we will stay at The Argonaught .
Some tips which you may find useful .
Buy the Muni pass for transport on the Cable cars , streetcars and buses , it will save you a fortune .
We paid $ 24 for 7 days and had our monies worth and more despite not using 2 days of the pass .
Go to Mamas on Washington Square for breakfast , you have to queue for 15 - 20mins but it is worth it .
More locally is the Hollywood Cafe run by a chinese husband and wife due .
Great american breakfast great service and you get to leave a message on a napkin for the wall .
Do a wine country tour it is good to get out of SF and have a few ! sips of wine .
If you go to Alcatraz have the audio tour included its worth it and very interesting .
Take a door to door shuttle to and from airport costs around $ 10 - $ 13 each , buts it worth it .
We tried to do public transport , we caught BART from airport costing $ 5 each plus a cable car to the hotel at $ 5 each .
It took over an hour and was a bit of hastle with the cases , for another $ 10 we had a shuttle back , which was quicker and easier .
Nice Hotel , but Bad enviorment !
This was a very nice hotel .
Convienent location , clean , nice staff and decent service .
The only problem I ran into was , no one knew anything at the helpdesk .
We asked how far a restaurant was from the hotel and if it was walking distance .
They told us it was a 8 to 10 minute walk .
As we were walking to the restaurant , we noticed that we had been walking for a good 20 minutes .
On top of that it was extremely cold outside .
We were very upset with the poor judgement of the hotel 's help desk .
There since of direction is VERY poor , so if you do n't know where you are going , find out before you stay at this hotel .
The area of the hotel is REALLY shady .
Homeless people on every singel corner harrassing you at any second they get .
I was surprised that a women at the front desk gave directions using the back door , then told me to ignore what ever is happening outside that door .
Outside that door was serval homeless people sitting on the stairs bothering bypasser ' s .
If you want to stay in a quiet , nice area , I suggest you stay in Nobb Hills !
Bad experience , not worth the upgrade , poor reception staff .
Spend a few days at Grand hyatt , few in Monterey and back to SF for a few more at Parc 55 .
That was the worst experience of all .
I did book quite in advance , requested a city view room , paid for an upgrade to a View room , mentioned that it was our honeymoon , and all I got when I arrived was a 21st floor room with a view at a construction yard at the back of the hotel !
After numerous attempts to request a front city view I was turned down with typical answers such as we 're fully booked , your room has a spectacular view , why do you want to change , try again tomorrow morning .
Apart from overlooking the construction yard and hearing all the noice in the morning the stay was quite ok .
Nothing special , rooms are big but the bed was not really comfortable , carpet was / looked dirty , bathroom ok , amenities ok .
Cleaning staff were superdb but the front desk were really bad and counld n't be botherd .
Same for the conierge who were n't very helpful and looked quite bored just sitting there .
The hotel caters for a lot of business travelers and lots of airline crews !
Did n't bother with any of the bar / restaurants as the are so many at close proximity .
Location was great though , oposite from the Shopping centre and the Bart / cable car stations that was very convenient .
Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was so much better , great rooms and views , superb beds , nice touches such as an ipod docking station , great bath and bathroom products , a lot friendlier staff .
Wish I had stayed there for all part of our SF stay .
Not worth the view upgrade unless they can guarantee a city view .
Other wise you get as bad view as you would get with a cheaper rate but on a higher floor !
loved the chancellor .
spent three wonderful nights [ may 22 , 23 , 24 ] at the chancellor .
there is no reason to look any further for a place to stay while exploring the city .
the hotel is spotlessly maintained , the staff was friendly , courteous , and helpful .
location - location - location 1 / 2 block to union square , macy 's 1 block , bart 3 blocks , powell street cable car out the front door [ cable car passes available in the lobby ] .
we will not only recommend the chancellor , we will return .

The Rex was the Best !
Found Hotel Rex on the hotel . com website , did a virtual tour and decided that was the place to be - - it was centrally located , had a wonderful hotel library bar , lots of art and books .
I was greeted warmly at the front desk , enjoyed the wine reception and had a great dinner at the restaurant .
And , my room was lovely .
Absolutely recommend it .
Also stayed at the Water 's Edge in Tiberon on New Year 's Eve - - another fabulous place .
For those who enjoy a different hotel experience , these are a find !
Nice Hotel , Great Location .
Great location close and / or easily accessible to fun activities in San Franciso .
Directly across the street from the cable cars with easy access to downtown and Chinatown .
Within walking distance to Ghiradelli Square , Fisherman 's Wharf and Pier 39 .
Much safer than hotels located in Union Square area .
Hotel decor was beautiful , similar to being on a cruise ship , with great wine gathering each evening at 5 p . m .
Rooms were small and narrow .
Rooms on the interior face other rooms , with no view .
Rooms on the exterior face bay , cannery or park .
Cannery side is noisy during the day and evening , even on the higher levels .
Fourth floor rooms do not have old wood decor like other levels .
Most of the staff is very friendly , however , some have an attitude that borders on arrogance .
Overall a nice hotel , but I would hesitate to pay the higher price for the Cannery or Park View rooms versus the interior rooms .
Cute but Tiny .
The hotel looks great from the outside , and the lobby and other decor is probably the best on this waterfront .
Go here for a drink or the free wine tasting they have every afternoon .
Staying here is another story , we booked in advance direct ( paid top ) and when we got there were given most probably the smallest room for 2 nights .
They told us they were fully booked , but we saw vacant rooms on the way to our allocated ( so mis timing from house keeping to reception was noted ) .
Spoke to house keeping to confirm other rooms were available and asked the head of house keeping to let reception know , they did and managed to change our room the next day ( no apology ) .
I paid hundreds of dollars for my stay here and the first day was spoiled by them because we were shuffed in the basement matchbox room .
It all smiley and nice .
They tried it on - I winged and got a better room .
Also had a massage at the other hotel who this hotel concierge can arrange , ( was a gift for my misses ) the massage cost us $ 310 ( inc tips ) and was pitter patter touching ( if you need the name for the massage place to avoid let me know ) .
Another client cancelled as we walked out ( in a huff ) as they ran 20 minutes late .
If you like a winge for your high rate stay here .
They give you yoga mats , my misses liked that .
Photo 's are of room before and room after winge .
Fabulous stay at the Argonaut .
We stayed at the Argonaut for 5 nights this month from 9th to 14th March and had a fabulous stay .
Quick and efficient check in with Mikel .
Room very clean , beds comfortable , no view though as standard rooms overlooking each other .
Problems encountered with TV and safe resolved quickly .
Good location and next door to cable car turnaround that takes you right through to Union Square .
Never had to open the door once the doormen always there to hand .
Blue Mermaid restaurant disappointing we had a poor meal there .
Wine tasting in the evening very relaxed and friendly altough my only criticism of this hotel would be on our last night , we were chatting to some people we had met and it was close to 6 o ' clock .
I had drunk half my glass of wine so my husband took it back along with his for a top up .
The man serving this night refused to do this stating the glass was half full , this embarrassed my husband as everyone else had received more than one glass in fact the people stopping at the conference had someone circulating with the wine topping them up .
This guy must of realised he had been rude and embarrassed my husband as he approached him 10 minutes later and offered to top the glasses up as the wine tasting had finished .
Shame this encounter happened as it would be my only criticsm of the hotel , I would definately stop there again but drink my wine faster to avoid any embarrassment ! !
Pretty good .
My boyfriend and I had stayed at Argonaut from Nov . 12 - 15 ( Fri - Mon ) .
We would have stayed Thursday night but when we checked in , the front desk rep informed us that there was no room available for us ; apparently something was wrong with a group of rooms ( although my guess was they just overbooked ) .
It was about 11:45p and having to get back into our car , drive across town and check into their sister hotel , Hotel Palomar , was n't our idea of fun , but rather than lambasting the guy ( which we witnessed another guest that was turned away do ) we accepted our fate ( and the complimentary free night ) .
We switched to the Argonaut after the first night , and for our troubles we were upgraded to a double queen room with views of Alcatraz and sent a bottle of wine and an assortment of nuts .
The nautical décor was interesting ; cute for families but not exactly my taste .
Some of the pros : Good location - While we were within comfortable walking distance to Fisherman 's Wharf and good restaurants ( go to Gary Danko ! ) , it was still in a very quiet and safe location .
The bathrooms were unimpressive but I liked the Aveda products .
The beds were comfortable and topped with fluffy pillows and comforters .
The Sony TV and DVD player was a nice touch , as was the free high speed internet connection .
As for price , it was pretty affordable ( our price was $ 150 / night ) for what you get .
Now for the bad stuff : The walls were a bit thin as we could hear our neighbors or people outside our door chatting away .
Each time we drove to the hotel , the valet guy was nowhere to be found so had to leave our car ( locked up of course ) at curbside and gave our keys to the front desk person .
Finally , the remote control for the TV was actually the Nintendo game control and therefore the only way to change channels was to go up or down .
It also did n't help that it was not wireless .
All in all , I 'd suggest this hotel if you 're an out of town cost - conscious tourist especially interested in exploring the Fisherman 's Wharf area .
One suggestion to the hotel - Sounds like being turned away for not having a room available has happened frequently in the past .
Rather than letting your guests show up and be disappointed , you should proactively call and let them know beforehand so they can go directly to another hotel .
This might also save your front staff from verbal abuse .
Excellent Hotel !
We stayed here with our fourteen year - old granddaughter for five nights in early July .
We had a king suite that was ideal for us since we all had our own space .
The entire hotel staff was attentive including the desk people heating a Hot Pocket for our granddaughter each morning in the employee lounge .
I would suggest a microwave in the room or at least one in public space .
The hotel was clean as a pin , quiet ( 9th floor ) , well located and fully met our expectations .
We would definitely stay again .
Reminds me of a sultry dorm room .
I only stayed here for one night as a vacation day before a business trip .
Since my company was n't paying for the hotel on my day off , I choose to use a discount hotel website that does n't tell you the name of the hotel before booking .
Basically , it is a place to sleep that is indoors .
I 'm 6 ' 5 and the bed is 5 ' 10 .
The TV is the exact version my 87 year old grandpa has , except smaller .
On a bright note , they had free cookies at the front desk - on a sad note , they were not good .
The bathroom is clean , which is always a good thing .
The room itself is very small - it reminds me of my dorm room from college , except with uglier carpet .
That 's about all .
Loved the Location .
We stay at many Marriotts .
The Renaissance Parc 55 was what I would classify as fine .
The lobby was pretty , however the hallways and the rooms were just average size and were a little worn .
The service was very good , however we had a major problem with the doorman and a limo company , which has yet to be resolved .
The location was wonderful .
You could walk virtually everywhere , or take the Powell Street Cable car 1 . 5 blocks away , the BART across the way , or an inexpensive taxi to most sights !
I would stay here again .
Hotel Rex Hotel Rex - nice place , small rooms , average at best .
Bathrooms very small .
Leaky showers etc .
Location makes it attractive .
Staff is average at best .
Not the best of Westin .
We stayed here four nights , including Christmas .
The lobby and location of the hotel are fantastic .
You are right in Union Square and just blocks from MUNI and the F Cars .
Our room was in the newer tower on the 18th floor .
It was an average room , not too large .
The bed was the usual Heavenly bed and very comfortable , but outside of that , a rather average room .
The parking was $ 44 a day , but compared to surrounding garages , that was actually the cheapest !
We did n't eat in any of the restaurants , but Sears ' Fine Dining and Lefty O ' Douls just outside of the hotel both had good breakfasts .
Overall , not the usual Westin experience I 've had in the past , especially as a Starwood member .
Just average .
An average hotel , I ca n't see why it is rated no 3 in San Francisco .
It does have good size rooms , good location some of the doorman are friendly helpful .
But the decor is tired the breakfast is n't worth it .
Pay for room only eat your breakfast somewhere else .
Also found that you had to ask for coffee at breakfast , it was never offered .
Some people describe this hotel as a Boutique hotel , it isn ' t .
It 's not modern enough no thought has gone into the decor .
If you stay here you will neither be impressed or annoyed , as I 've already said it 's just an average hotel and you can pay less for an average hotel .
Great location , lovely hotel .
Fantastic location for tourist attractions .
Room clean and ( relatively ) restrained in theming .
Lobby relaxed setting .
Internet access useful .
Wine tasting a bonus .
Staff service efficient and courteous .
Loved the Orchard .
After booking another hotel in the city , I found the Orchard on thiswebsite and immediately cancelled the other reservation and booked this one - - - THANK GOODNESS ! ! !
It was everything we hoped for .
It 's a beautiful new hotel - - very clean and comfortable , and in a great location .
Our room was on the 8th floor , facing the street but it was very quiet .
The continental breakfast was good and more than adequate to start your day and all of the staff were very friendly and helpful .
A great bargain for this city .
Fantastic Hotel , Awesome Location .
View of Chandelier and Bathroom
Overall Happy .
Stayed May 2007 , in town for business .
Room 1300 The + : - Great location , close to cable car , shopping , food ! -
Very pleased with the staff - Nice view , high floor , no significant noise issues - had to close window anyway at nights - chilly ! -
Free coffee and cookies downstairs in the lobby - Liked the small hotel character and the lack of a huge / commercial lobby - They had accommodated my request for hypoallergenic pillows and high floor ( thank you ) - Free wireless internet access with no problems
The - : and Wes , do n't get upset please . . . : - ) - moldy smell upon entering the room - room needs updating ( I think they are in the process ) , carpet needs help . . . , bed headboard needs replacing / cleaning , room needs better electricity plugs and they need to e made more accessible , lamp shades have stains - room needed more dusting , especially the walk - in closet and the bed headboard
Overall , I was pleased and loved the convenient location , but I can only give 3 dots ( neutral / average ) , only because of the above negatives .
I was there for business and stayed by myself .
I would return for a similar trip , but not for a family / couple stay until the renovation is completed .
I think when the rooms get upgraded I will be able to give 4 or 5 dots .
Lousy Concierge and Desk Service .
The hotel itself was adequate but I could n't get passed the staff . When I asked questions they looked confused and asked me irrelevant questions in response .
I can excuse people who are not completely fluent in English but not in a hotel front desk role .
The Concierge was also disappointing .
He responded in a quick hurried manner to my inquiry and was n't genuinely interested in offering assistance .
I may be too critical but these are important positions .
These people are the face of the company and have the most impact on the clients impressions .
Great overall value !
What a great value in a great location !
I thoroughly enjoyed my one - night stay .
Easy to get in and out of this hotel .
Staff was very available and knowledgeable .
I found everything very convenient about this hotel .
Attractive interior .
Seemed less crowded than other hotels in the area .
Rooms are a bit small but cozy and just right for a short stay .
Staff was very friendly and helpful .
Just a smooth , pleasurable experience all around , and the value was great .
I hope they continue to do a nice job with what they do !
Great value for money .
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here .
The reviews on this site are spot on and this motel offers great facilities , clean rooms and a great location in a nice neighbourhood .
All the main tourist sites are 15 minutes walk away .
We found a great Japanese restaurant called Wasabi and Ginger on Van Ness Avenue just 3 mins walk away - highly recommended .
We will be back !
Nice weekend spent out of the hotel .
My wife and I spent a weekend at the Westin St Francis in Feb 2003 .
We were very happy with the rate booked via Expedia , however upon check - in , we were presented with an upgrade ( SPG Elite ) to a room with street view overlooking Union Square .
Well , I believe they ulitmately put us in a parlor room with a 1 or 2 foot view of the square .
The room was set too far back and the view was blocked by the building itself .
The Westin Heavenly bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large enough for 2 to get ready in the morning .
The staff was fine , valet was a bit slow , and parking was very expensive ( $ 36 per day ) .
I would return to San Francisco , however I would probably stay at a different hotel in that area .
Great location .
We loved the cosy bar !
Hotel Rex is a nice , quiet hotel on Sutter Street , 3 ' walk from Union square .
The hotel is well located for cable car links , financial district and shopping centre of San Francisco .
We loved the hotel because it was close ( or well linked ) to main attractions without having the noise and buzz of a touristic hotel .
The breakfast was good and generous ( . . . even though a bit expensive ) .
For a cheaper breakfast , right on the corner of Sutter street there is a diner where classic American breakfast is served .
Starbucks coffee is on the corner as well as a 24hour supermarket .
The staff was friendly and very helpful .
The interior of the lobby was well decorated .
The bar 's decoration is reminescent of a 1960 's living room / office .
The rooms were well sized and clean .
Nice Outside , Horrible Inside , Too much $ $ !
Upon driving up , this place looks cute .
Hanging baskets , newly refinished OUTSIDE front doors , freshly hosed down .
Alright .
But then , you enter .
Ooh , yucky .
Very outdated and dirty .
The bathroom had very outdated cabinets that were beat up .
And to add insult to injury , we paid exactly 807.00 for two nites ! !
Total ripoff for what we got .
Do n't see what the fuss is about .
After reading so many positive reviews about this hotel , I booked it for my stay over the New Year .
Once I arrived I was very disappointed .
I 'd been placed in a ' smoking allowed ' room , despite requesting a non - smoking room .
Asking for a room change straight away , I was refused , and was told that these requests can only be made by booking direct through Best Western 's website .
Therefore , I spent 4 nights in a constant tobacco smelling room told to ' open windows ' ! ( December in SF ? ! )
Views ? Well no , on this one too . I was facing a brick wall , with a plant pot as ' greenery ' On the positive side , the bed was extremely comfortable .
Location is also great , with a couple of supermarkets within a block from the hotel .
A Hidden Treasure .
Just like a majority of San Francisco Hotels , the Orchard rooms are on the smaller side , not tiny , just smaller .
Though they do have large bathrooms and well lighted , with Aveda Products !
I was very impressed with the hotel because of it 's friendly , welcoming staff , modern rooms and location .
The Orchard is in walking distance of Union Square , Financial District Chinatown .
The price was very reasonable ( $ 149 on Friday , for one night , which included parking and continental breakfast . )
One very nice amenity of the hotel is there is a DVD player in the room . It was nice to be able to come back , in the evening , and enjoy a movie .
They have a nice selection of movies to borrow at no additional charge .
Also , the continental breakfast was very yummy and had a nice selection .
With the high cost of hotels in San Francicso , this was an excellent , modern hotel with a low budget price .
Great Hotel and Excellent Value !
I stayed at the Chancellor on July 5th and 6th .
I arrived a day earlier than planned , and the hotel was able to accomodate me immediately .
All of the staff that I encountered was friendly and helpful .
The room was smaller , in the European style , but it was a perfect size for me .
The tub was wonderful - it was very deep and perfect for a long soak after a day in the city .
The bath salts and rubber ducky were an excellent touch .
From the hotel , it 's easy to access BART and the cable cars , and it 's within walking distance of great shopping , resterants , and theater .
For a first time San Francisco visitor , it is darn near perfect .
The Chancellor is an outstanding value for the dollar .
I highly recommend it for its value , cleanliness , and convienance .
Missed this place as they changed policy .
Had to cancel our booking at the Argonaut as they changed their policy to being a non - smoking property on the 1st of May and did n't inform us .
They are trying to charge a cancellation fee .
I would likefor other people considering the Argonaut to know that they are non smoking and their reservations guy was impossible to deal with .
Questionable Style , Bogus Ranking .
My partner and I are very fond of Kimpton properties , especially their knack for picking historical venues to re - do and make into special hotels .
This property is not like many of the others .
The design looks almost Disney - ish and is over the top with regard to the nautical theme , so be prepared .
I would guess you either hate it or love it .
We hated it .
But beyond the issue of design taste , there appears to be a larger issue with service and attitude here that we rarely have seen at other Kimpton hotels .
We had booked a weekend of three nights in a deluxe bay view room with a king bed , paying an additional 100 bucks for the benefit .
When we got to our room it had two queen beds so we knew we got put in the wrong place .
Upon returning to the front desk we met Mason , who told us that we had paid for the view and not the bed configuration , and that he could put us in a king bed the second night .
Bad form .
So we said we 'd be willing to do that , however we did n't expect to pay the upcharge for a room that was n't what we had booked .
The view is nothing if you are cramped in a bed smaller than what you have at home .
Mason asked us if we had booked on Expedia as if we had made some second - rate reservation .
We booked directly with Kimpton , so this was not the case , though we noted the show of attitude . Surprisigly bad . . .
Thus began about 30 minutes of arguing , Can we see your manager . . . , etc . - you know the drill . . .
We checked out soon there - after .
Long story short , they never apologized for the mixup even one time .
Never once said I 'm sorry .
They acted like it was our mistake , and their official statement was that they do not guarantee bed type no matter what you paid for .
I showed him my reservation and the fact that it said plainly Deluxe King room with a Bay View . . .
It did n't seem to matter to them that we had it in writing .
In fact if you do look on sites like Expedia or Travelocity - that is what you will find even today .
When you have it in an email from Kimpton and they do n't honor it . . .
this is a reason to never stay with them again .
There is no way the Argonaut shoud have a number 2 ranking on TripAdvisor .
This just is n't a classy San Francisco property or experience .
I have this advice to the web - inclined for travel ; If the place looks tacky in a little 72 dpi photo . . .
well guess what - it only get 's worse .
I 'll NEVER stay there again ! !
Being a hotelier myself with a 5* hotel chain in Asia , Westin St . Francis is really not up to par .
I stayed there in Sept 2005 .
When me and my family arrived after a long flight from Hong Kong , we were already very tired .
Still , we had to deal with the long check - in process just because the staff there were so inexperience and did n't really know what they were doing .
So finally , after maybe 30 mins , we finally got to our rooms - at the old wings .
All I can say about the room was - TERRIBLE ! ! ! It 's old and small .
A little like the BB in a small country side in the UK .
I would never have expected that from a so - called 5* hotel like that !
The bathroom was also extremely small and basic .
With white tiles and a almost rusted shower head .
It was no way that I would pay that amount of money for that type of room .
So finally after a serious complaint , they moved us to the new wing which was more decent .
A little more like what you have expected from an international hotel chain .
But still , we have decided to change to the Grand Hyatt after a few days coz the Westin 's service is so too terrible - slow delivery of our luggage ( we 'd to call 3 times b4 they brought it up ) and my relative even got her handbag stolen in the lobby coffee shop .
The only thing I can say about this hotel is the location , but then Grand Hyatt is just round the corner also and I would rather stay there .
For business travellers or young executives who are used to the 5* international chains , Westin St Francis is not for you .
Quiet , comfortable beds , no views , free parking .
Got a cheap rate online of $ 189 for two queens and free parking which in San Fran can run you up to $ 50 a night .
Nice beds , good linens , dated but quiet , great location .
Nice bar two blocks east , great breakfast one block west on Van Ness where you pay for a great egg / bacon sandwhich .
Hotel breakfast was coffee , muffins and fruit ( again free , so it 's worth it if you have kids ) .
If you just want a nice bed to sleep in , great location and two blocks from cable car , go for it .
Otherwise , no view , no frills place .
But the free parking and in / out privileges make it worth it !
Nice folks run the place , too .
Location , location , location .
We just returned from a fabulous trip to San Francisco and stayed at the Westin St . Francis on Union Square .
Pros and cons to this property .
they bill themselves as a 5 star hotel and yet there were some basic problems with our room / stay that told a different story .
We stayed on the 17th floor of the new tower and LOVED the speed and ease of elevator service .
However , the room itself was very bland / boring / empty .
Peeling wallpaper on one of the walls , tub caulking coming out and the tub itself was not very clean .
Very basic amenities in the bathroom also .
The air conditioning did n't seem up to the task of keeping the room cool .
very stuffy the whole time we were there .
The ice machine on our floor was broken throughout our stay so we had to take the elevator up or down one floor to get ice .
None of this was totally horrible , just a bit disappointing for the price you are paying for this hotel .
What you are paying for though is the excellent location in the city .
We were hardly in the room because we were exploring the city from this great location on Union Square .
One of the highlights of the trip was our breakfasts .
HIGHLY recommend the Sears Fine Food restaurant , just a block from the hotel on Powell .
Long lines move quickly and the Swedish pancakes are worth the wait !
Also good is Max ' s , which is around the corner from the hotel also .
NIcer atmosphere .
excellent omelets .
Great restaurant for lunch is Roxanne 's Cafe .
up the hill on Powell .
Enjoy San Fran !
Wow what a surprise .
From reading about a zillion reviews before booking a hotel for myself and my 14 yr old daughter to spend a weekend shopping at Union Square in SF , I was expecting a small but quaint , fairly clean room with a great location .
I got all of that , but the room was n't just fairly clean it was spotless .
I accidently spilled a 1 / 2 gallon of bottled water on the carpet and anyone who has spilled something on carpet knows you blot it up , not wipe it up , well , I grabbed a couple of bathtowels and started blotting . . .
the towels were soaked but quess what ? ?
NO DIRT , NONE .
The carpets had to have been cleaned or the towels would have been dirty .
I was impressed the room smelt clean when we first entered , and it was .
The location was excellent for shopping with my teenager and the valet parking was included with the room , so we did n't have to fight traffic , we just bought a three day muni pass and zoomed around town on the cable cars .
The people where very helpful in the hotel and one of the elevators was broken and being repaired , but our wait for an elevator at the longest busiest time was never more than 5 - 6 minutes top .
The price was great , the service was great and the room clean , it was a safe location , and for the price you can not get a better deal .
Awesome Hotel with a couple quirks .
When I transferred to San Francisco , my company put me in the Parc 55 Hotel for 20 days .
For 20 days , you 'd better like the place you 're staying !
And it turns out , I did !
The location is perfect .
Parc 55 is located right on Market Street , across from the best mall I 've ever been to ( Westfield ) .
It 's like Vegas for shoppers .
The actual hotel is really nice .
My room had an amazing view of the Grace Cathedral and the sunsets were priceless .
The room was very clean and the staff was amazing .
The only issue I really had was with the internet - $ 12.95 a day and no wireless .
Not having a wireless connection was a huge inconvenience .
Also , most hotels I stay at offer internet free of charge .
After 20 days , this expense was pretty painful .
As someone who works in the tech industry , I will definitely look for this the next time I book a hotel .
Excellent location .
The hotel is clean and comfortable ( with a pillow menu should need it ! ! ) , but it 's main selling point is it 's position - perfectly located in the heart of San Francisco , just across the road from Union Square , and on one of the excellent tram lines .
Ultimately , SF has so much to offer you should spent little time in the hotell , but when you do , the Chancellor is perfect as a well - run city - centre hotel .
( Just as a word of advice , we almost stayed in a hotel in the Fisherman 's Wharf area of the city - glad we didn ' t ; this area is a bit tacky and seasidey with little to really offer other than trips to Alcatraz , which is not to be missed . Much better to stay around Union Sq , and take a tram ride . )
Not worth it !
View from the Elevator
Free Wine at the Rex .
The Rex is centrally situated near Union Square and easy to find .
The bedroom was well appointed and spacious but could have done with air - conditioning .
We had breakfast in the adjoining restaurant once , but as it was a little pretentious with a limited menu we preferred to go to Lori 's Diner a few doors along the street .
The staff were all very friendly , especially the barman who was both knowledgeable and interesting to talk to .
There was a free glass of wine each evening in the bar , which also provided some musical entertainment some nights .
The lounge bar was a very pleasant place to sit and go over the day 's events .
Overpriced with tiny rooms .
This hotel is n't worth the price .
Rooms are very small , traffic is horrible , and service is poor .
Beware the hotel room doors that open out into the hallway - we almost got smacked !
We booked online , and paid extra ( $ 449 ) to get a room that was supposed to have a Golden Gate Bridge view .
We were very disappointed in the room , which was so narrow that only a small passage existed between the end of the bed the wall .
As for the view , you could see a smidgen of the bridge , if you looked past the noisy street , through the trees , and if you leaned to the left and hunkered down a little .
I looked at the fire evacuation fire evacuation map on the back of the main door and saw that our room was one of the smallest on the floor .
I went back to the front desk and asked the manager on duty if we could have a larger room or one with a view .
He condescendingly explained that hotel rooms in bigcities like San Francisco tend to be smaller than rooms in places like Las Vegas .
He ended up giving us a somewhat larger ( but not spacious ) room with a nice Alcatraz view .
The hotel is centrally located at Fisherman 's Wharf , but that means getting to and from the hotel is a nightmare of traffic snarls with the accompanying noise and pollution .
Valet parking was terrible , too .
When I left our car with the valet , I asked how long it would take to get it back .
He said to call 5 - 10 minutes ahead .
When we requested our car around 5 pm , it was a 20 minute wait .
We ordered room service breakfast , which arrived on time , but lacked presentation .
The croissant was naked on a plate ( no cover , no plastic wrap , just out in the open ) , and we got no jam , no butter , no glass of water , nothing .
The shower head is mounted terribly high on the wall .
I 'm 5 ' 5 , and could barely reach it .
The shower curtain was mounted on a straight rod , and kept billowing in while I showered .
Wonderful hotel ... book now !
Just returned from a four night stay at The Argonaut .
The hotel is situated in the best bit of Fisherman 's Wharf .
On the whole the Wharf is tacky , but not as bad as I expected .
The proximity to the cable car stop is a definate bonus ( especially if you are on your own and worried about safety ) .
The staff were friendly at all times and always acknowledged you , and you always received a friendly welcome from the doorman .
The decor , although wacky , is very tasteful and not at all overpowering .
I had a room facing the courtyard ( a view would have been nice , but I was hardly in the room during daylight hours ) .
It was totally spotless , you would honestly think that it had been furnished and renovated especially for your visit .
Lots of extra touches that set the hotel apart , such as flat screen TV , DVD , Starbucks coffee , modern phone and clock radio .
Free internet in the lobby was a huge benefit and was not abused .
Ate breakfast in the hotel a few mornings and was impressed with the food and the service ( unlike some other reviewers . )
I would definately return to The Argonaut on my next visit to San Francisco - during my time there I saw no other hotel that I would rather stay in .
If you plan on staying at the Wharf , stay here .
The other chain hotels ( Holiday Inn , Radisson etc ) look run down and dated from the outside .
A Great Place to Stay .
My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the Orchard Hotel during our trip to San Francisco ( 4 / 24 - 4 / 26 ) .
It was outstanding .
Great location .
Super views ( we were on the 10th floor ) .
Very clean and comfortable room .
The service was extremely friendly .
The hotel itself was everything we could 've hoped for and a little bit more .
We stayed at two other places during our trip ( one in the city / one outside ) and found that this hotel provided our most enojoyable / comfortable stay .
The only drawback was that we were under the impression that our breakfast was included with the room and were then surprised to find out that was n't the case .
Unfortunately , nobody told us this up front and we found out last minute ( as we were about to order ) .
Very minor note overall .
we walked down the street and had a great breakfast at Lori ' s .
I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy San Francisco .
It is a boutique hotel with the ammenities of a major chain .
We loved it .
Boutique value in heart of SF .
Stayed here for just 1 night for a business trip , and found it through other user 's reviews on Trip Advisor .
They were right . . . . .
I thought this was a great bargain for a boutique hotel right in the heart of San Francisco .
Large bathroom with nice tile work , large stall shower .
The style , the location , and the price all added up to a good experience .
Two complaints though : the bed , although not uncomfortable , was a little lumpy .
There 's no box spring , just the mattress .
And the free WiFi never actually worked for me .
I could n't connect .
My colleague did n't have any trouble , so maybe it was me .
But that was a little annoying .
And the restaurant in the lobby was nice as well .
Overall it was a good experience , and I 'd recommend for business travel .
Do n't trust them for Events or anything remotely complex .
My family were staying at the Argoanut for my wedding .
I 'd heard great things about Klimpton Hotels , but something went terribly awry .
The reservations were completely screwed up .
They tried to give us rooms , that were already reservered by others , and did not tell me till I called a month before the wedding to reconfirm .
I left mulitple messages and NO ONE would call me back .
Meanwhile my family is wondering if they should cancel their travel plans to come to my wedding .
Out of desparation I called a manager three weeks before the wedding , in tears , because I had not idea if my family had rooms , despite that I blocked off 7 months beforehand .
Although the manager found us rooms , but the real disaster is when they charged the wrong cards for the rooms , that was was horribly embarrassing .
My whole family was mad and yes , the Argonaut made me get in the middle of it to straiten it out .
I was late to my own reception dinner , because they said they 'd have the car ready in 15 minutes , and it took them 45 .
I think it was because the curbside staff was so busy chatting up the girls walking up and down the street , they forgot to do thier job .
The place is nice , and the prices are great - but do n't count on them for anything important .
Relying on the Argonaut was by far the most stressful and horrible aspect of my wedding .
They really ruined the experience for me .
Every time I think about my special day , I cringe , and the Argonaut debacle is the first thing to come to mind , eventhough I try really hard to forget it and move on .
Do n't make the same mistake I did .
Terrible in Tuscany .
We had been traveling quite a bit this summer .
We were in Calfornia for about 15 years in a row , for almost two weeks .
We used to stay in downtown San Francisco , then found a nice small motel place near the wharf , but the mattresses became too lumpy for our backs .
So , we were up in Calistoga ( wine country ) and needed a short two night stay before we headed home .
I had read reviews of the Tuscan Inn in prior years and thought it would be a good choice .
We were severely disappointed .
The hotel manager did her best to help us , but certain problems with the hotel simply can not be corrected .
The rooms that face the streets are very noisy due to tour buses , local buses and traffic .
The courtyard room we were assigned was dark and dingy and since we are fresh air oriented , when we opened the windows we heard 30 + air conditioning units humming away .
Couryard rooms are darker than street rooms .
The interior of the room was sort of Rococo with a mishmash of colors .
The room itself was small and crowded with old furniture and knick knacks .
The bathroom had several problems . First , it was tiny , old and not at all modern .
When I woke up early in the morning to use the facilities , a light outside on the vanity wakened my traveling companion .
The inn advertises coffee and tea and biscotti in the morning .
Regrettablyt , the biscotti were tiny pieces , quite inedible .
The lobby is very busy , with lots of tourists rushing around , apparently quite a few on bus tours .
We think the hotel needs a major redoing in almost every respect .
Before we reserved , we asked the front desk about the mattresses and were told they were new .
My side had that typical depression you find in a hotel bed where a person has been sleeping on the edge and the mattresses have not been turned or simply were not of good quaity to retain any support .
We later in the day checked out several large chain hotels in the area , and found them not more expensive and just in more fantastic shape .
So , we will never stay at this inn again , barring major renovations .
We advise travelers not to be impressed with what the hotel sounds like , and to pass it by .
NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel .
Traditionally reputed to be one of the best in the City , this hotel unfortunately disappointed again .
Years back , on my wedding night of all things , this hotel told me I had no room ( after making a reservation months in advance , ordering roses , champaign , etc . ) .
Now , years later , I decided to give them another chance .
Here 's what I 've experienced : Paid that little bit extra to get a room that overlooks Union square instead of ugly roofs .
My wife , who visited the room first , told me the hallway and room smelled like urine .
Thinking she was overly sensitive , I reserved my opinion . .
When I arrived , I had to agree .
Quite disappointing to pay the big bucks and smell urine .
After trying to forget this , I take a shower .
Wife notes as I 'm getting out that there is a patch of long black hair on the shower wall .
Neither she nor I have long black hair .
Gross and no excuse .
Then , tonight , the main restaurant and bar advises , at 11 pm on a Saturday night , after the big USC v . Cal football game , the bar is closed .
Go to the reserve lobby bar which closed at 12:00 .
Closing this early on a busy night in the City ?
Are you kidding me ?
Based on my past experiences in the City , you can do much . . . much better elsewhere .
I recommend the Omni or Hyatt for better experiences in the same ( or lesser ) price range but with better facilities and service for the price .
Could n't even order a movie without calling the front desk to order it without giving them my credit card no .
Like they did n't have it already when I made reservation or my wife made spa reservation .
Weak service for very high prices .
You can certainly do better .
St . Francis seems to be resting too comfortably on its old reputation .
In the last few years , this hotel has gone down hill in getting rid of a classic restaurant , a separate good old SF bar and a nice lobby .
All this without any mention of the $ 45 + they charge per night to park your car .
Do n't forget to add that steep charge to your room rate .
Reputation only ?
Tiny bathroom
Lousy Walls , Lousy Internet , Lousy Room Service .
I stayed at the Argonaut to attend a conference .
If you stay at the Argonaut , you will be at the mercy of the people in the rooms next to you , as there is virtually no acoustic insulation .
You can hear conversations at normal levels , as well as the TV .
The internet is agonizingly slow .
Can not watch streaming media and large files take forever .
I also notice other computers appeared on my places section ( MacOS 10 . 5 ) That was a bit unnerving .
I used room service one night and actually got a recorded message asking to leave my name and room number .
After 20 minutes I called again and got the same message .
So I just kept redialing and got through .
I order soup and a salad .
The food arrived 40 minutes later , and the soup was lukewarm .
The decor is OK , if you like a nautical theme .
I do n't think I would stay here again .
An exceptional facility , value and hosts .
Before traveling through Europe using Rick Steves ' travel guides and philosophy where he promotes staying near the center of urban areas , we assiduously avoided these locations as overpriced , ill kept , and unsafe .
We nearly let our past beliefs dictate where we would locate when we visited San Francisco .
To our delight we found the Castle Inn to be a great value , fantastic location , fastidiously maintained and providing a secure parking area for our car - - all inclusive in the price of the room .
Our room looked recently redecorated and contained a refrigerator , coffee maker , microwave , a king size bed with an excellent mattress , and a table and chairs that offered an inviting place to read or update our travel log .
Our hosts , Marshall Arlene , were exceptional .
They made us feel like valued friends .
They provided us with maps , a suggested itinerary of things to see during our stay , and a detailed sheet of the various modes of public transportation listing the stops and fares .
They made reservations for us for the tours we wanted to take and even found discount coupons for us in various travel guides .
When we asked for advice on places to eat , they offered a compendium of choices depending on our ethnic choices - - all within walking distances of the Castle Inn .
The continental breakfasts they served were fresh , tasty , pleasantly presented and replenished right up to the end of the serving hours .
Because of Marshall Arlene 's attentiveness and attention to detail and the needs of their guests , we assumed that they were the owners of the property rather than employees of the facility .
I would suggest to the owners that they have a rare find in these two people .
They should also be on the payroll of the Chamber of Commerce ; they exude a love and enthusiasm for San Francisco that is infectious to anyone entering the motel to inquire of a vacancy .
Thanks for making our stay so memorable .
With your help we , too , left our hearts in San Francisco !
Hotel Good .
Beware the Breakfast !
For our Silver Wedding Anniversary we decided to go round the world , one stop , albeit only for 2 nights , was San Francisco .
We 've used Best Western hotels quite a lot , so had no fear of booking the Tuscan Inn .
Reviews on - line were generally favourable - as is ours .
We arrived on the evening of december 5th , and the check - in staff were helpful and efficient .
The room was a fair distance from the elevator , but adequate , and no different to most others in this class of hotel as far as amenities went .
Our room looked out onto a very small internal courtyard , plants and flowers made it quite pleasant , but one had to be careful about the shutters because other guests could see into the room .
The reverse applied , of course !
The next morning , we went down to the adjacent restaurant , which had been in prior publicity material , for breakfast .
We did n't enjoy it , because some of the staff seemed to have little English , and misunderstood our requests .
We were given saute potatoes that were inedible because they were so hard and undercooked , and the coffee was n't so good , either .
We sent the potatoes back , and the bill was reduced by a small amount .
The Eagle Cafe on Pier 39 is a far better bet , and has a view of Alcatraz whilst you 're eating .
We used the hotel 's safety deposit without any problems , and the checkout was good and swiftly done .
The hotel is quite close to Fisherman 's Wharf and the terminus of one of the Cable - car lines , and also close to the streetcar line , so getting into the city centre was easy .
The general area that the hotel is in is a bit scruffy .
The only quibble we had with the Tuscan Inn was that outside our room was a large cupboard , and staff kept going in there , made quite a noise , and finished off by banging the door .
Overall it was quite good , but not so good as to be a ' must go back ' sort of place .
We paid 172 ( stg ) for our two night stay .
Westin Horror .
View from window of old tower
Old section getting a bit long in the tooth .
I travel to San Francisco at least once every year and have been staying in Starwood hotels since I joined their club about five years ago .
I have bounced between the W , St . Regis St . Francis .
What I do like about the St . Francis is the old section overlooking Union Square because the ceilings are high and the rooms have that sense of old San Francisco that I remember as a child staying there with my family .
However , the best part is that the windows open wide letting in the cool S . F . air and the sounds of the city complete with the clanging cable cars traveling up and down Powell St .
A view over Union Square to Tiffanys , Macys Nieman is so cIt y .
It really does n't get much better than that for a city experience .
If you can time it right be sure to book a lower Union Square room to watch the Chinese New Year parade from your window .
What I do n't like about the St . Francis is that the new gourmet retaurant that has taken over what was one of the most wonderful hotel bars in the city .
Nothing against the restaurant itself as I have yet to dine there .
Cocktails are now relegated to the lobby which diminishes what was once a Grand entrance .
Now the lobby is kept impossibly dim littered with too warn , never were attractive furnishings .
All in all , I will probably opt sometime again in the future for the Union Square experience ; but I do miss the bathrooms at the St . Regis .
Good Location ! !
This place is just as the way it has been described .
The pics of the rooms are the same as they present them online .
Nice Location .
Easy walkable accessibility to Pier 39 and the Tram Ride .
such nice folks .
After much research of hotels in which to stay in SF prior to a cruise , I finally decided on the Best Western Tuscan Inn near Fishermans wharf .
It was nice , the folks there very helpful - - letting us check in early without so much as a frown - - polite and eager to help in any way .
I would love to go back and stay again - - this time a little longer .
It 's easy to catch a taxi to anywhere you want to go , and the bellman was very helpful .
The beds were comfortable with nice down comforters .
The food was good at the resteraunt also .
A good place to start a cruise ! !
Outdated .
My brother 's family my family stayed in 2 rooms in the Tower building for 7 nights .
We do a lot of traveling and have stayed in many different hotels ( everything from a Comfort Inn to the Mandarin Orientals the Penninsulas ) , and have never been as disappointed as we were with this hotel .
We are definitely NOT picky people and ALWAYS try to give the benefit of the doubt to the hotel and their staff .
I have NEVER given a hotel a one star rating that itself tells a lot on my part .
In addition , I am a Starwood Preferred Guest and our last three hotel stays have been in Westins .
We arrived at the hotel ( our time 2 am - SF 11 pm ) after traveling for 5 hours with a 9 mo . old another child .
When we arrived at the hotel , not a single person asked if they could assist us with our luggage .
They saw us , but did n't even bother to open the door as we were struggling with the baby and the luggage .
After check - in ( which went ok ) , we asked 3 different people ( including front desk ) for luggage assistance to our room .
20 minutes after checking in and STILL standing in the lobby , WE had to hunt the bellman down .
We asked kindly if he could bring the luggage as quickly as possible , as we were extremely exhausted ( esp . with the baby ) .
He said it would be 10 - 15 minutes for him to deliver the luggage ( which we had no problem with ) .
After 30 minutes of waiting in our room , we called the front desk and complained that our luggage was not with us yet .
The bellman came after another 10 minutes and proceeded to THROW our luggage into our room and tell us that we need to be more patient ( this , after waiting 40 minutes for him to deliver the luggage ) !
He not only threw our luggage into the room , berated us for not being patient , but also slammed the door on the way out !
By this time , it is after our 3 am !
My sister - in - law called the manager and complained and they did give us breakfast the next morning , but it had already left a sour taste in our mouths .
However , we still we willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the rest of the hotel their staff .
We found the hotel staff and the hotel itself to be very unaccomodating ( with the exception of the Concierge - they were very helpful ) , cold , and unwelcoming .
We did not feel any comfort coming back to the hotel at the end of the day and really did n't feel like we could enjoy the lobby or anything .
Although it was spacious , the rooms itself were cold , outdated , very worn out , dim , and did not make you feel comfortable ( and these were the tower rooms - ca n't imagine what the old part felt like ) .
The environment made us not want to spend any time in the hotel or the room .
On top of that , room service was not only VERY expensive , but there were absolutely no choices on the menu .
Our first night there , our daughter was starving .
Since we do n't eat meat , there was NOTHING on the menu that we could order .
Even the kids menu was closed - not even pizza !
So she had to settle for cookies milk !
After that , we went out got food ( there are numerous choices right outside the hotel ) .
This is a HORRIBLE , unwelcoming , very old hotel and it needs some serious updating in every aspect of the hotel .
Having paid approx . $ 300 a night ( a piece for each of our rooms ) for this hotel , we felt we had completely utterly wasted our money .
For us , the hotel experience is half the vacation , and this was a complete waste .
This hotel DOES NOT live up to the Westin name .
Do n't stay here .
My brother stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero hotel and he said that was a palace compared to this dump .
Better off going someplace else .
Great hotel , location and friendly staff !
We stayed at the Omni hotel after reading all the reviews on Trip advisor .
I have to say that they were true !
The Omni hotel is a great place with a very friendly staff .
We arrived early ( 10:30a ) and a room was waiting for us .
After signing up on their website , we ended up with coffee and juice delivered to our room every morning .
We also had breakfast included .
The restaurant was great .
The staff there welcomed us each morninng and we had the choice as far as menu .
I had steak and eggs one morning . Just fabulous !
The meat was very tender .
We will definetely stay there again .
Perfect location as well .
Good Experience .
We stayed at the Chancellor over the christmas holidays in dec ' 04 .
It was a very good experience - the hotel is charming , the staff is helpful and nice .
The only complaint is that there was only one elevator working . . . so i would check to see if the second elevator is working before making a reservation on one of the higher floors .
The location was amazing - we had never been to san fran before and the cable car ride to the wharf was right across the street .
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that was traveling to san francisco ( and especially if they 're looking to shop ! ) .
Excellent stay .
We spent 4 nights at the Chancellor in October 2004 .
The rooms were n't excessively large but everything that we needed was there plus a few things that were n't needed but made the stay more fun ( sweets and a rubber duck ! ) .
We were on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel but were never disturbed by road noise .
The bar was comfortable and the restaurant food very good .
Coffee and biscuits in the reception area were a treat .
The location is ideal for exploring the city .
A Muni pass is a must .
The lady need to adjust her attitude !
This is a MOTEL , not a HOTEL .
Do not expect too much .
The bed is comfortable , bathroom is clean , location is not bad .
These are the plus for this place .
However , we were not pleased due to the following :
( 1 ) The wall is very thin and you can hear the coughing of neighbor room very clearly , not to mention if they are talking or watching TV or something else .
Unluckily , our room has a connecting door with another room , and this make it a door in the middle instead of a wall .
It 's like someone sleeping right beside your shoulder .
( 2 ) This motel advertise complimentary breakfast , however , they really wish you do n't go there to touch it .
If you happened to bring food up for your room members , they will watch you like a thief and that special tone of talking make you feel you are stealing their breakfast instead .
Suggest to the owner : PLEASE DO N'T PROVIDE COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST IF YOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO .
OTHERWISE , BE A LITTLE GENEROUS ! !
The old lady really need to change her attitude . ( By my standard , she is not qualified to work at front desk at all ) .
So , do n't just look at the ranking , make sure you are staying at a MOTEL , NOT a hotel .
With the price we are paying , we can book better hotels for sure .
They advertise to be the best kept secret , please do your own research before you go .
We will NOT return ! !
First Time in San Francisco - great choice of hotel .
I 'm so delighted that I opted for the Renaissance Parc 55 for my first ever visit to San Francisco .
We arrived v early on a flight from Vegas as we needed to cram in a full day 's sight - seeing in SF .
Took a taxi to the hotel and expected to have to dump our bags and come back later to check - in .
But to my pleasant surprise , we were able to check - in around 8 . 30am at no extra charge .
Receptionist was lovely as were the porters - v helpful with recommendations .
Dashed out for our trip to Alcatraz followed by a city bus tour .
Finally crashed back at hotel later in day .
Room was very comfortable and clean and quite high - 14th floor ?
Felt a bit dizzy at the window !
Went to visit friends in the evening so did n't get a chance to use other facilities in the hotel .
Picked up a hire car in the morning - did n't realise there was a Hertz desk in the hotel which would have been v handy - had arranged to pick up car at Westin St Francis .
Brought car back to hotel where a bunch of porters attempted to load myself , 2 seniors and 8 pieces of luggage into a Ford Mustang convertible .
They deserve an award for patience and for ability to re - configure the contents so we all fitted in ! !
They seemed very concerned about us leaving SF and driving to LA ! !
I 'd booked through Octopus Travel on the web and got a great deal but I would pay more next time if necessary to stay there as the staff and hotel are worth it !
Overbooking !
We had a lot of problems finding a hotel in San Fran for the particular night we were staying there due to a major convention in town .
We were supposed to be traveling the week before but my husbands business trip got moved and we had to change the dates .
I spent many hours searching for a new hotel and finally decided on the Argonaut .
We were really looking forward to it .
Today we received a call that they had over booked and rebooked us in the Handlery Hotel and they would be paying for it .
Unfortunately the Handlery is no where near the same as the Argonaut .
It 's less than half the price and looks no where near as nice .
When I called te Argonaut back I was told there are no rooms in the city which is probably true since we ca n't find any either and they over booked as the result of a computer glitch .
I did n't feel that the apology was sincere and there was no concern over my wasted time or the effect this might have on our vacation .
I think we should have a least been offered a free stay on our next trip to SF .
We wo n't be staying at this hotel or any others that are part of this chain .
Overrated ! ! ! ! ! ! !
If you enjoy being herded from hotel room to hotel room , be sure to stay at the Argonaut Hotel .
Are also great at denying the guests accomodations one purchased and are great at projecting the blame onto the guest and the the travel agencies they are affiliated with .
In the end , the room assignment was sub par for comfort , customer service paltry and effort to provide the services they so proudly advertise was non - existent .
Would never return to the Argonaut Hotel .
In the end though , the Argonaut Hotel is so self righteousness that a poor review will be viewed as another nemesis and nothing more .
Upsetting Experience .
My granddaugher and I were in SF over Chinese New Year / President 's weekend .
We arrived early , understood that the room may not be ready .
We sent to lunch , came back around 2:15 - room not ready .
Granddaughter feeling ill .
We ask when can the room be ready , but never got a response back from the clerk or housekeeping .
Around 2:45 I ask a different clerk when the room would be ready .
Did not get response back from housekeeping or follow up by the desk clerk .
Around 3:00 I ask yet another desk clerk when will the room be ready .
She did give me a discount on the room as it was not ready on time , but at that point the money was not an issue - I just wanted a room , any room , as my granddaughter was feeling worse .
Time passes . . . . . . . . . . . . we finally get a room around after 3:30 .
But the keys do not work .
Housekeeping has to open the door for us , but now my granddaughter is upset and starting to cry , I am upset , so we go down to the lobby and say we are not staying , we are leaving .
The desk clerk says you are welcome to leave , but you must pay for the room .
Needless to say , we are all upset at this time , and there is no talking to the deskclerk .
So , we leave the hotel , and go home .
We never stayed , we were in the room at most 30 seconds , we are upset due to the management staff , and yet we must pay for a room that we did not use .
I felt that the management staff could have done better , that all they needed to do was follow up on my requests for a time when the room would be ready .
In short , the Chancellor will never receive a recommendation from me .
Nice for the PRice .
Tuscan Inn at Fisherman 's Wharf Single Room
Loved the Tuscan Inn ! ! !
We stayed at the Tuscan Inn in August while visiting San Francisco .
We would highly recommend this hotel , on arrival we were given an upgrade to a junior suite which was perfect after a long flight from the UK .
We found the staff extremely helpful and the room was clean , tidy , a decent size and the bed was extremely comfortable .
Would definately recommend this hotal as the location is perfect , only afew blocks from Fishermans Wharf .
Thanks for a great stay !
They looked after me very well .
Me in a sling with walking stick in my room at The Orchard .
St . Francis is coasting on location Obviously , great location that ca n't be beat . . .
cool hotel history , too .
Very nice lobby .
Good breakfast in the Oak Room ( but pricey ) .
That 's it !
It 's all downhill from there . . .
front desk staff : SURLY RUDE . ( I 've had much better service from airline staff checking in at the airport . )
Historic rooms : dumpy , dingy , noisy , musty . . . 2 star at best . ( We heard every toilet flush as well as neighbors having sex . . . not good ) .
We wo n't be back .
Average .
My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights after a wedding in Las Vegas .
First problem was unloading the car outside , there was nowhere to park .
Next problem was when booking in , we were informed there was a mistake in the price that we paid directly to the Hotel some 4 months in advance , we were told that it was an extra $ 160 to pay .
Why in the previous 4 months they could not have informed us is anyones guess , so paying the extra was a big let down .
Finally when we stopped off in the bar on our last night for a drink we were told the bar was closed , it was 10 . 45pm .
We went out to another bar and lo and behold on getting back at 12 midnight the bar was open .
All in all a nice hotel but our experience was soured
terrific value , great location , highly recommended .
We stayed for 7 nights in mid - September 2005 had a great holiday .
We picked the Chancellor based on Tripadvisor reviews ( no other hotel nearby could offer the same good value combined with great reviews ) for the location , and we were not disappointed .
I booked by contacting the hotel direct , months earlier , got a confirmation e - mail shortly afterwards .
My requests for a quiet room , facing the back , high - up , with no connecting doors were met ( the only noise we had was a loud radio or TV one evening , but it stopped before we went to bed ) .
The view at the back of the hotel was still quite striking , especially at night .
Hotel itself has some character , with a beautiful art - deco type mirror behind the bar .
Lifts were effective ; we did use the stairs a few times , but 15 floors is along way !
The room was quite big enough and ( like Wes , the manager , whose responses on Tripadvisor are highly entertaining ) I found it no problem using the toilet !
No A / C needed - ceiling fan was only needed a couple of times , and we left our windows open during the day .
Room was very clean ; the shower very effective ; the bed comfortable ; the safe worked ( 2 other hotels we used on our holiday had faulty safes ) ; the choice of pillows a terrific idea ( as a sufferer of back neck pain , this made a real difference to me ) ; the laundry came back promptly ; the bar service was good .
The staff were excellent : check - in took about 30 seconds ; bags were taken up to our room immediately .
The housekeeping staff were friendly and always said hello ( in Vegas , they avoided any eye contact , and one rarely saw them ) .
When we needed a light bulb replacing and I wanted a special pillow , the staff responded immediately ; all the staff smiled made us welcome .
The lady at the tour desk may have never actually smiled , but she was polite helpful .
The restaurant staff were efficient most of the time ( though on 2 mornings they were slow and forgot part of our order ) , so we ate breakfast at the hotel 6 out of the 7 mornings .
The food was good , and the free coffee ( including de - caff . ) cookies much appreciated .
There was a ' meet the staff ' evening one night , with free food and wine , and we got to meet Wes , the manager - if they hold one while you are there , I recommend you go .
Location of hotel is brilliant : cable car stop just outside ; short walk to Powell St cable turntable , metro , BART and bus stops ; ATM in hotel and one next door ; Sears for breakfast 2 doors north ; Lori 's diner for good burgers c . 200 yards north .
Wallgreens chemist / store on same block ; loads of shops around Union Square ; some beautiful architecture in the area , and good restaurants ; several film locations ( Vertigo , especially ) nearby ; many of these places , and other tourist destinations , are easily walkable from the hotel .
We would highly recommend the Chancellor .
We plan to visit San Francisco again one day , and we will book again with the Chancellor , with no hesitation .
Thanks to the users of Tripadvisor for helping us choose it , and thanks to Wes and his staff for an excellent stay .
Spent three nights last week .
We had an inside room , facing onto the courtyard .
The room was small , but it was mostly due to the king - sized bed and some rather large pieces of furniture that were in the room .
The bed was really comfortable .
The staff was very friendly and attentive .
We drove , so that was a disadvantage as we chose to valet our car for the unlimited in and out privileges . I thought it was pretty pricey at $ 29.00 per night plus tax .
The best feature of this hotel is location , location , location .
We loved that we could easily stroll all of Fisherman 's Wharf , Pier 39 and North Beach .
We 'll likely stay here again .
Home Away from Home .
What a lovely comfortable Hotel . .
We were greeted by Max the dog as we entered .
The lounge lobby is very comfortable and artsy .
The location could n't be better .
We loved the helpful staff and the complimentary glass of wine in the evening .
We 'll be back !
Could have been better .
We recently spent 3 nights at the Westin St Francis while we did enjoy our stay I felt there were a few things that could have been better .
We received a very warm welcome on our arrival it all looked promising .
We had just arrived from a very long international flight and had an extremely tired baby who needed to sleep .
I had previously emailed and called from Australia to confirm a cot would be in our room on arrival .
The girl checking us in advised it was not there yet but would be sent up immediately .
After at least half and hour it still had not arrived so we decided to take her out for a walk .
On our way through reception we asked again were assured it would be sent straight up .
An hour and a half later we returned - still no cot !
We finally rang exasperated and pleaded for one - finally it came about 20 minutes later .
Not quite good enough something so simple should not take 3 requests .
Other than that , the paint was pealing off the ceiling in our bathroom which was surprising and not up to standard for such a property .
This is an extremely busy hotel so not the place to stay for a quiet relaxing time , however it is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk or take the cable car everywhere .
The room was spacious and comfortable other than the pealing paint it was very nice .
Staff were mostly all very friendly overall we did enjoy our stay .
nice hotel , overpriced .
I got a special rate for a conference at this hotel . . . really the rate was not all that special at $ 279 / night .
And I was disappointed to have to pay $ 12 / day for the gym . . . a tiny , cramped , 2 - room gym w / old equip and only 3 elliptical machines .
The hotel is beautiful in the lobby area and some of the larger conference rooms are very ornate .
Do n't get me wrong , it was a nice room , comfy bed and nice shower . . .
I 'm just glad my company was paying .
For my money , I would have tried to find a better value .
Although , I 'm pretty sure that the rate has something to do with the Union Square location as well .
Horrible Experience ! !
Beware We had read great things about this place .
The rooms are large , indeed .
But , if you are on the 1st floor , you will hear your neighbors walking around upstairs .
Those are the good things , now on to our stay .
Our experience before we got there was troubling .
We called from Monterey to verify a late check - in .
The front desk was rude and said that ' they liked to get some sleep around here , too !! '
We planned on checking in by 10 pm .
Upon arrival , the front desk clerk ( after 15 silent minutes ) said that the room we had reserved ( family suite ) was not available ! Absurd !
We tried our best to find out how they had given our room away .
We have a family of four and needed the suite .
After an hour of tense discussions , we finally were put in a room with two beds and a roll away bed .
That sufficed for one night .
The clerk then made a concession on the price for the rest of our stay .
We were tired and accepted his offer .
It seemed reasonable .
The next day , the owner called .
It impressed me that he cared , until I found out that all he wanted to do was retract the agreement on price that had already been signed and charged .
It goes on and on from there . At first he said he would ' honor ' the agreement , then he changed his mind later in the day .
Our entire stay was marred by the whole mess .
More tense moments occurred upon check out .
Customer service is not in their vocabulary . $ $ $ $ is .
To top if off , they intentionally charged an unauthorized amount on our credit card !
This amount was considerably higher than the agreed upon rate .
San Francisco has many better alternatives than this ! !
Hospitality missed the boat here .
Room bate and switch after arrical .
I booked a room with 2 queen beds here on the internet over a month in advance .
Upon arrival I was told that the room was only available for the first night but that they would put me in two separate rooms on separate floors one with one full bed and one with a twin bed .
As we were traveling with our two teen sons this was not a reasonable option , they both would not fit in a twin bed nor were we comfortable with separate floors .
The owners insist on blaming the internet provider saying that the providers oversell the rooms .
Even backing it up with horror stories of several times people came in from overseas with 2 week reservations that they had to turn away .
I have booked rooms though the internet multiple times and never had this problem , all the other motels I stayed at had a block of room available for the internet providers that they would not sell themselves .
I believe this motel will sell the rooms that people buy on the internet and trade the internet customers down to their lower end rooms .
I did n't mention that the hotels direct quote was 42 dollars higher per night then the prices available on the web at the same time .
We cancelled the second night and found another hotel .
Needless to say I would never stay there again .
Argonaut and SF .
Found this hotel very agreeable .
Nice touch with the wine hour if you could make your way back to the hotel in time .
Room was absolutely fine although no real view for us .
Liked the loation as our first time to SF and the cannery bar next door had live music most of the time which we loved .
It 's not a cheap hotel but the service was fine ( if not exceptional ) and had 3 good nights sleep with not too far to go to anywhere .
Only one minute walk to the queues for the trolley turnaround ' and about 12 mins walk to pier 39 and all the touristy things ( sea lions ) there .
Made San Francisco one of our best memories from our RTW trip .
Good Hotel , Phenomenal Location .
I stayed here at the end of March 07 for a bridal shower .
I 'm an SPG ( Starwood Preferred Guest ) member so booked through their website .
I indicated that two of my friends had never been to San Francisco and asked if we could have a room with a view .
When we checked in , we got just that !
We were on the 27th floor with a full view of San Francisco facing out toward the Golden Gate Bridge . It was incredible .
About the room - There were 3 of us girls in one room and we had plenty of space for all of our luggage and purchases .
The bathroom was also a decent size but only large enough for two of us to be getting ready in there at once . . .
There was a desk in the room and full closets .
The beds were incredibly comfortable .
The room was perfect for folks who want to see SF and are n't planning on just hanging around the room .
The overall location of the hotel was also great !
Tons and tons of shopping and restaurants in vicinity of Union Square .
Some downsides of the hotel : The internet was shockingly expensive .
Also , when I checked in ( at approx 2PM ) there was only 1 concierge working .
By the time I got to the desk , there were at least 5 people waiting in line behind me .
The overall feel of the hotel was rather classic .
That is , maybe for an older generation .
It was n't a hip place to hang out . . .
Fancy might be the best word .
If your parents want to go to San Francisco , I would recomennd this place .
If you 're looking for a cool hotel with a modern atmosphere , I 'd look to some of the other hotels on the square . . .
Fairly Decent .
Stay I took my wife to SF for our third anniversary becuase she always said she wanted to go there .
Having been only a few times and not really knowing the lay of the land , we chose to stay at this hotel based on reading other reviews and realizing that this area was , at the very least , not one of the places to avoid .
We purchased a flight and hotel package from Expedia , so I am guessing we paid about $ 230 a night for the room .
As I understand it , that is a decent bargain for SF hotels .
On the basis of that price , I would recommend this hotel .
However , I would n't ecpect it to be anything special .
In the past , i have stayed at the W and thought that was a great hotel .
This is n't the W .
But for the price , it is n't a bad stay .
The Hotel is large .
The lobby is n't grand , but who really cares .
The employees are n't the friendliest , nor are they particularly helpful .
However , I found that to be the case for most San Franciscans anyway .
Even the people who live here will tell you that the people are cold and rude .
I would agree , but having parents from New York , it did n't faze me .
The room is a basic typical hotel room .
No fancy furnishings .
No extra special amenities .
One thing I found lacking was a safe , which would have been nice to have .
Another thing it lacked was an interface on the TV for checking your bill or checking out .
I found that odd .
Finally , it had an internet connection , but you need to have your own laptop to get it it and that was inconvenient .
Normally , I am not much for using the internet on vacations , but I found that having it in a place like SF is necessary for making reservations at restaurants and pulling up directions to things before you head out .
Needless to say , they charge you $ 13 / hr for it anyway , which is rediculuous .
They should provide that for free .
The bed was a bit uncomfortable , as it is a cheapie and is very bouncy .
Everytime my wife woke up to go to the bathroom , I woke up and vice versa .
They also do n't provide very nice blankets - typical foamy blanket .
I will say that I was SHOCKINGLY SURPRISED that the sheet was a FITTED sheet , and not a flat sheet that comes off the bed at night .
That was the first time I have EVER seen that .
All hotels need to do that .
I would suggest that if you do stay here , you get a floor up high like we did .
It was very quiet for a noisy city .
The location was fairly good .
It is right across the street from the BART , the cable car turnaround [ which goes up Powell ] , and the F line [ which goes to Embarcadero and Fisherman 's Wharf ] .
After touring around most of the SF downtown , I can say that this area is probably the better area to stay in .
Fisherman 's Wharf is definately not the place to be [ tourist trap ] , and other areas do n't seem to be in places near stuff .
This place is near a lot of things , or is near the transportation that gets you to everywhere .
Overall , I would recommmend staying here for this price .
If you pay more , then maybe try elsewhere .
Paying for Location .
I stopped over at the Chancellor hotel for 5 days in November with my boyfriend and overall sadly we were left disappointed by our stay .
My main criticism of this hotel relates to the poor quality of the rooms .
The decor and standard of my room ( and others that I saw when the maid was in ! ) were shabby and in need of repair , rather than charming or full of character .
I may sound it , but am definitely not an overly fussy guest ( ! ) having generally enjoyed my stays at different types of small / large / cheap / expensive hotels and accommodation , all over the world .
Reading some of the other reviews , to ensure that you enjoy your stay , I recommend emailing Wes the General Manager beforehand so that he will juggle things in your favour .
If you are not overly concerned by the standard of the rooms and location is everything to you , then this hotel is definitely for you .
I think this hotel relies too heavily on its location in San Fran ( and friendly lady selling refreshments in the lobby ! ) and should really consider investing in a significant makeover to the benefit of all its guests . .
Great Place to Stay .
We had booked into the Chancellor for five nights from the 5th August .
I had emailed Wes Tyler requesting a room on a high floor overlooking Union Square and mentioned that it was my wife 's birthday on the 6th .
We were extremely pleased with the room we were given and my wife was very surprised and happy to receive a birthday card from the staff , together with a bottle of wine to celebrate and a gift of a photo frame .
Fantastic service from Wes and I would also like to say what good service we received from Mao and Sue .
All together a wonderful experience at a great place to stay .
Perfect Location , Priced A Little High .
We stayed at this hotel on a trip to San Francisco Sept . 22 - 24 .
The location is terrific - two blocks from Fisherman 's Wharf .
We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms .
Upon arriving , there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking - we had n't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .
We were told to take our luggage out and wait for the concierge , who never showed up .
There were about five other cars in the area - we were told if we needed the car , the valet would get when we needed it .
There was a fee of $ 29 per day for the parking .
We parked the car and never needed to take it out until we left .
We checked in during the daily wine tasting the hotel provided .
That left the small lobby loaded with people blocking the desk and walkways .
The wine tasting is a great idea but the lobby is so small that the crowds block access .
I was totally amazed that the other guests did n't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms .
Check in was quick .
Our rooms were very small but beautifully decorated .
We had no view - all we saw out the window was the back of another wing of the hotel .
There was a mini - bar but it was locked and we did not have the key .
There was a small refrigerator in the room .
The furnishings were lovely .
Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom , which we would have preferred , but our sink was inside the bathroom .
The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries ( shampoo , conditioner , creams ) were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .
The beds were comfortable , the shower was hot , the towels luxurious .
There was an ice machine on our floor but the soda machine was out of order .
There was a 7 - 11 convenience type store down the street so we simply got soda there while we were out .
Our air conditioner was terribly loud our first night there .
The second day we stopped at the desk and spoke to the friendly clerk who had it fixed for us when we came back that night .
There is a moderately priced Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had a deceont dinner at , but there are so many restaurants on the Wharf we preferred to eat there .
We found an IHOP around the corner for breakfast .
It is a 2 block walk to the wharf and the location is very convenient .
We also were within walking distance of the cable cars and even walked up to Lombard Street .
We paid $ 169 per night .
While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small , but the location was just perfect .
I 'd recommend this hotel to others , but now that I have seen the area , might stay elsewhere if I could find a better price .
Excellent stay !
My husband , daughter , and I stayed at the Castle Inn for 2 nights last month .
The service there was fantastic .
We got great food recommendations ( Versa even made reservations for us and called us when we were out and about sightseeing to let us know what time they were for ! ) and plenty of help with directions and suggestions for what to do and see .
The rooms were perfectly adequate , clean , and comfortable .
The only down side to our stay ( and it was a small one ) is that they do n't have cribs there .
Even still , we would stay there again without hestitation .
Great service , great location , free parking . . .
great stay !
Save your money for a real san francisco experience .
My husband and I travel to San Francisco frequently .
We usually stay in small hotels unique to the city .
This time , along with a family member , we were traveling for a medical treatment .
I chose this hotel based on reviews and location and reserved two rooms for two nights .
When my surgery was cancelled and I called the hotel to see if we could make an adjustment as only my husband and myself needed one room for one night , all they could say was well , you have to pay for both rooms for both nights .
No offer to try to rent the rooms .
When we arrived and suggested that at least we could donate the rooms to a city agency for the needy , they were horrified and insisted that we should let them rent the rooms .
One was rented for one night for half price .
This hotel has a 72 hour cancellation policy which is self - serving and punitive .
They appear to only care about tourists who are making one trip to San Francisco and to have no interest in cultivating follow - up business .
Further , it turns out that this establishment is not a hotel but an aging standard motel .
I recommend that tourists skip this place and pick one of the city 's charming small hotels for a real San Francisco experience .
NOT the typical SPG hotel , much worse !
I recently spend a week at the St Francis on business ; It was a fright from the moment I got to my floor .
The doorman , front desk staff , and bell staff were attentive , but did n't warn me about my room . . .
It was on a newly renovated floor that smelled of mothballs ( I was told it was the new carpet ) , the whole 11th floor smelled so my window ( which opened ) was of little help .
The bell staff that escorted me to my room noticed immediately that the room was not made up properly and left to collect the towels , robe , and missing pillow .
The amenities were less then I would expect , I 've received better at a Hampton Inn .
They were happy to press my suits , but were unable to shine my shoes .
Housekeeping skipped my room twice during my stay , and the hotel never offered an apology ; only a they 'll be right up .
All in all , it was a beautiful hotel , but the room was far too small ( albeit a old hotel ) for the price and the door banged into the bed when I opened it .
For the money , stay at the ritz or four seasons . . .
Love the hotel , but this stay was disappointing .
I travel to San Francisco two or three times a year , and one of my favorite destinations is the St . Francis . Francis .
It 's a wonderful location , right across the street from Union Square and just blocks from the city 's Theater District .
But my stay this past Memorial Day weekend was , overall , disappointing .
First , the positives : the room was clean and the Heavenly Bed was as great as always !
The lobby is lovely , and I love the way the hotel has leveraged its marvelous history by providing so many vintage pictures of its past glory days entertaining kings and presidents .
The negatives , however , far outweighed the positives ( at least on this visit ) : * Check - in was excruciatingly slow , even though we checked in at about 11 pm , with only one person in line in front of us .
There were three people available to check guests in , but none was very efficient . *
The coffee maker in our room was defective .
When I called Service First to request a new one , the representative gave me the 5th degree on whether I 'd properly operated the one in the room .
We never did get a replacement , and decided to go to the Starbucks down the block instead . *
There was paint peeling from the wall in the bathroom in about a 2 square foot area . *
Even though I am a Starwood Gold Preferred Guest , we did not receive turndown service or a newspaper during our two nights at the St . Francis . *
Our room had no hotel directory in the black portfolio provided in the room .
Again , I contacted Service First to request one .
It never came .
I 've stayed at the St . Francis five or six times in the past 5 years and - - until now - - have always had a very pleasant experience .
I am hoping this past visit was an anomaly , not the beginning of a new trend .
The maneger was a jerk !
At the time we reserved the rooms in July , 2007 , we had requested an early check in , if possible .
I had reserved 3 rooms for 5 nights for three of my employees , my wife and myself .
Upon arrival at 1:30 two of the rooms were not ready .
Despite travelling all day we took the opportunity to sightsee for a couple of hours .
The check in desk assured me that they would be ready no later than 3:00 .
When we returned at 3:30 , the rooms were still not ready but we were assured that they would be ready shortly .
So we waited and waited .
At 4:30 the second room was ready and the third room was ready at 4:55 .
I thought the wait was excessive and I asked to speak to the manager to register my concerns .
The general manager promptly arrived and told me he was sorry for the wait .
However , when I tried to get a word in during the 2 + minute conversation ( ? )
the guy kept talking and talking , never letting me express my complaint .
Finally , fed up with this , I held up both hand and said fine , I 'll go to my room .
Sensing my irritation , he offered to buy me a beer ! A BEER !
So much for customer relations .
At the Chancellor Hotel it seems to stop at saying I 'm sorry .
The staff especially Harris and Rory were excellent .
GRF
Nice Place to Stay .
Enjoyed my stay there while in town on business 12 / 07 .
Friendly staff .
Clean rooms .
Good location right off Union Square .
Very close to China Town entrance .
Nice big bathrooms .
I would stay there again on my next business trip .
Good , but something . . . was . . . hmmm . . . .
I have to admit , I had a great rate for my stay at the Omni and I wonder if that is the reason for my experience .
Great front desk staff , maid service was good , but my room . . .
I walked in the room and the first thing I noticed were stains on the carpet .
Normally , this does n't bother me at all , so I ignored them .
Then I noticed another larger stain in front of my window , as if someone had spilled something and it settled into the carpet .
Again , I ignored it , thinking I was just being picky .
Later that night , I tripped a little bit on a piece of carpet that had been pulled up as I was walking into the bathroom .
I know this sounds silly , but by this time I was thinking . . .
what is going on here ?
I would come back to stay at the Omni , but I have a feeling that it will need some upgrades to the rooms , soon .
Friendly Great hotel , great location just off Union Square .
Staff very friendly and helpful - nothing a bother .
Only drawback no tea / coffee facilities in the room but they do have free tea and coffee in the bar in the morning .
My room was just beside the lift but you would n't have known as never heard anything and I was n't an early riser .
Lots of people I met were leaving early so you would have thought I would hear them .
Hotel restaurant good value and food excellent .
Small with NO Air Con .
The hotel is in the middle of downtown which is great if you are looking for the downtown city life and not the cute charm of San Fran .
The hotel 's curbside passenger loading parking was full which made check in a pain because it is located on a very busy street .
Once in the check - in was fine .
The room however was very small and the bathroom was Tiny .
The decor was nice but it looked more like a surface renovation than a deep clean renovation .
New Paint , and some trendy decor does n't change the overall feel or quality .
Pillows were horrible and left me with a neck cramp the next day !
The worst part of the hotel is that it doe not have any air conditioning ! again , no air conditioning .
Being that san fran is usually cool you would n't think it would be a problem , but when we open the windows the street noise was so loud we could not sleep , and with the windows shut it became very stuffy .
Seriously , what kind of hotel does not have air .
I had a different hotel booked the next night and called them at 8am the next morning and they let me check in early because I could n't even imagine getting ready in the tiny bathroom at the Chancellor .
My husband and I could barely fit in the bathroom at the same time and we are very small people !
No counter space either .
My advice is book a hotel in an area with more charm , unless you want to be downtown , then i would suggest a hotel with Air conditioning !
I do not recommend this hotel . save your money .
Westin St . Francis - - Not a Great Westin Experience I was thrilled to be going on this trip to San Francisco with my husband as it was our first visit to the Bay area .
I picked the Westin St . Francis because it looked rather nice and besides , with a Westin , how could you go wrong - - - Not .
We checked around 8:30 pm and Check in was the high point of our stay , it was swift and efficient .
We were on the 29th Floor of the new tower and thought we would be spared the noise from a make shift music festival on the corner of Geary and Powell .
No such luck .
I had requested a refrigerator before we arrived because I knew we 'd be checking in late , and was told by the Express Service Manager , that she had taken the liberty to arrange that service for me .
I asked the front desk and was told that it would be there .
It wasn ' t , and arrived only after I called 4 times .
Finally at 11:30 pm , when I said , that I would like to go to sleep , they brought my refrigerator .
They tell you that the cable car stops right at the door , what they do n't tell you is that you wo n't get on the cable car unless you walk down to the turnaround on Market St , and only after you walk down Powell St . , where every panhandler of San Francisco waits for a handout .
We were supposed to have a city and bay view room .
This was not the case , saw the city , but not the bay .
Housekeeping in the hotel was okay , but there were days that my husband had to find the area where they threw out ( or were supposed to ) throw out the trash because ours was n't picked up .
I was taking a shower and went to turn the water off and the handle came off in my hand .
This is hardly what you consider you 'll be doing after paying $ 500 a night for this hotel .
Twice the concierge gave me incorrect information on where to wait for a tour and then for the return shuttle to the airport .
If you stay here , check your bill before you leave .
I was there for 4 nights , and charged for 6 days of internet service ( double charged on two of the days ) as though they did n't make enough revenue on my room .
Would I stay here again - - not in a million years and the management has heard from me via snail mail .
This hotel does not live up to the standards of a Westin .
They need to send the management to the Westin Moana Surfrider in Honolulu to learn the fine art of being a Westin property .
A right does n't make up for a wrong .
Long before our arrival at St . Francis for our holiday weekend stay , I had made reservations at their Oak Room for Thanksgiving dinner .
Considering the upscale price of the dinner we were anticipating a first class experience .
What we encountered was no class at all .
The hostess who greeted us in the doorway offered us a seating arrangement with two tables that did n't match in height and was crowded up to the buffet selection area .
We looked around and there were ample unoccupied tables of the same height that could have been placed together .
We told her our name and number of guests for the reservation but there was no check list that she looked at from what I could observe .
She called for the manager to see if another table would be ready .
Instead of suggesting that we sit at the bar and wait for an acceptable table we were given argument that the makeshift table was our only choice .
We have had dinners many places where the waitstaff had no idea they would be serving a party of 5 - 6 and they gladly pushed tables together and fixed the place settings for us .
In this case it was an advance reservation for a party of five .
We had even stopped by an hour early to ask if the dinner included complimentary wine ( which it did not ) and told the hostess we would be back by our reservation time .
We should have realized when she did n't even check off our name that it was not as selective a place to dine as we thought it would be .
The discussion with the manager escalated to the point where instead of accommodating us he refused to seat us and called hotel security .
I guess we were holding up a line of 3 couples and that was the maneuver to get us out of the way .
A representative from the hotel said that the Westin can not control the management of the restaurants they allow in their building but they were willing to credit our rooms for one night and suggested a restaurant that offered similar fare for the inconvenience we were experiencing .
We provided our own transportation to a nearby hotel restaurant , Fournou 's Oven at the Stanford Court , and it was a $ 470 night that the Oak Room could have earned besides denying their waitstaff a generous gratuity .
As for the Westin itself , I agree with comments made in other reviews .
It has a magnificent lobby and friendly bellhops but the housekeeping leaves much to be desired .
Our sons ' room had robes but ours did not .
Our shower curtain had questionable matter on it ; a burned out lightbulb was never replaced , the bulb was set out for the maid to see and replace ; wet carpeting had pieces of glass on it and a hand towel had traces of blood which indicated that someone broke a glass , was cut , and it did not get cleaned up thoroughly before we checked in .
An empty water bottle was found under the edge of the bed 3 days into our stay and the coup de grace was the wine glasses .
The clean glasses were actually speckled with chunks of debris .
Even with the windows closed , sirens could be heard throughout the night - I thought I was in NYC with all the police / ambulance activity that we heard .
The bed was indeed heavenly but the early housekeeping activity did not allow for late morning indulging .
The heating system was not very quiet either .
The bathroom amenities did not include a disposable showercap , mouthwash , q - tips , shoe mitt , or cotton balls like we are used to receiving at other hotels such as the Hilton , Marriott , Hyatt and SwissHotel .
In conclusion I think if a guest is a Starwood elite member then it should mean something to the hotel and they should book us accordingly .
Unfortunately it is human nature to remember the bad and overlook the good .
The manager of the Oak Room whose name I am not allowed to mention in this review spoiled an otherwise nice time in the city .
Acceptable accomodations in a great location .
After making reservations many months ago for very specific room requirements ( we needed three no - smoking rooms , two that adjoined , another for a handicapped room ) - - and having confirmed these reservations the day before arriving - - the hotel had no knowledge of the arrangements .
After a lengthy delay at the front desk at check in , we had could not get the adjoining room for my children .
The rooms were acceptable , nothing fancy but comfortable and clean and decently appointed .
When we called for feather pillows we were told all the rooms had them .
But ours did n't .
r A note on the lobby : this is a oddly shaped place , fairly long and narrow , the front desk at the far end , and coldly decorated .
The breakfasts that were included featured a good buffet that we thought met our needs .
You could also order from a menu .
Food is n't luxury , but was fairly decent .
The real positive of the Renaissance Parc 55 is the location : right near the shopping along Market Street , a couple of blocks from Union Square ( more higher - end shopping ) , and just a block or so from the first ( or last ) stop on the trolley .
After the initial screw - up upon arrival , we thought this hotel was terrific for our family 's needs .
Do not Stay at this Hotel Its a Dump !
I would agree with previous contributions .
This is hotel is not really a hotel but rather a run down MOTEL which you would expect to find in a very poor part of town .
It is being dishonest to say it is a hotel .
The room we were allocated was dingy , shabby and poorly decorated and depressing .
I found the staff to be surly and unhelpful .
The so called advertised breakfast is so poor as to be laughable .
Nura - grain bars with a few pieces of fruit and yogurts .
The pictures on the website are deceiving and deceitful do not reflect the true nature of this MOTEL . It is vastly overpriced for what it is in reality .
If it was half the price it is now , it would still be overpriced .
If you value your time in San Francisco , do yourself and your relatives a favour and find somewhere else .
SignedA now wary traveler who was deceived by the hotel .
A Mixed Bag .
You ca n't beat the location with a stick , but the suite was awfully small .
The thermostat gave us a choice of baste or chill until frosty .
At $ 80 - 100 this is a 4 star but at $ 150 a night I was looking for a little more .
Wharf on one side , ghetto on other .
On one side of the hotel was Fisherman 's Wharf just a few blocks away .
On the other was a kind of seedy area with lots of bums .
The neighborhood the hotel is in was n't the best .
We always kept it in our heads that we should get back to the room before it got too late .
There were some problems with people at the front desk , one younger guy ( ca n't recall his name ) was uncooperative and unprofessional .
Our airconditioner was n't in the best working order .
We had a nice size room with 2 double beds .
My parents ' room with only one king bed was really small they wanted to change , but the hotel was booked up .
Breakfast is n't included in the room rate , although there is a restaurant adjoined to the hotel with decent , average - priced food .
I think it was around $ 10 . 00 for an omelette .
We expected a better hotel and even thought This is it but it was reasonably princed .
There are so many SF hotels , we should have taken more time to find a nicer place .
It was n't necessarily bad , just not any thing great , either .
So - so .
Parking here is overpriced , considering a fairly lengthy wait to collect the car from the valet service .
Hotel Internet access is incredibly slow .
Rooms are reasonable , although last stay I had a staff service corridor behind one wall , with staff banging trolleys into the wall repeatedly ( enough to jolt the bed ) .
Bell - staff are downright rude .
I got asked to make sure I left the handle to the suitcase up in future ( because it 's so much effort for them to do , obviously ) .
I could n't find my luggage receipt and was in a hurry ; they said There are too many bags to look and did n't intend to let me have my luggage back .
I pressed the issue and they let me point to my luggage in their storage room .
Not sure if they expected me to just give up and let them keep my belongings or not , but they sure gave that attitude . -
10 out of 10 there .
My second stay here , and the Hertz counter still never , ever had anyone working there . ( Avoid booking anything to pickup / drop off at that hotel from hertz , but that 's another story ) .
Made to feel unwelcome !
hotel room itself was beautiful and very clean , however , this is probably the worst service we have ever experienced !
After a 10 hour drive to get to the hotel we spent 45minutes trying to get into the hotels car park { following the hotels directions } .
Once in the car park we were welcomed by the valet guys .
When checking in to the hotel the guy on the front desk was very rude and more or less threw our passports and credit card back at us .
Once in our room it took 45 minutes for our bags to arrive .
This is when we realised we had made a horrible mistake in coming to this hotel !
The bell boy was totally unpleasant and threw our bags on the floor taking no care with them at all .
We believe in tipping for good service , therefore due to the bad service we were not tipping this guy !
When he realised he was not getting a tip he refused to leave our room !
When he eventually did leave he slammed the door shut !
Within the next 5 minutes we received 2 prank phone calls to our room .
We decided that after such a long trip we would order room service , the food was delivered promptly , but was not worth the money at all .
When the food was delivered to our room I lifted the pen to sign the bill and the waiter who delivered the food turned to my husband and asked him if I was " allowed " to sign for the food !
When we looked at the bill we were quite shocked at how much of a tip the hotel had allocated their staff !
The following morning we needed to print our tickets to Alcatraz , my husband spent an hour trying to arrange this with the concierge ( we had our lap top with us it should have been a 5 minute thing ) .
We were told that they could not let us wait at reception for our 1 sheet of paper it would be delivered to our room would cost $ 3 ! ! !
What a rip off !
We found that any time we wanted to get out car from the very expensive car park we had to wait 20 minutes !
The attitude of all the staff we met was awful , they made us feel totally unwelcome .
An awful experience all round !
We have stayed in Westin hotels many times in lots of different locations and this one was such a let down .
When we left we were asked to fill out a customer satisfaction survey , I raised all the above points provided our home address , home phone number , work number , mobile numbers and e - mail address asking for a manager to contact me but no one ever has .
was great very clean ,
Strobe lights . . .
This 100 - year - old hotel has a great location and impressive lobby , with nice crown mouldings as one reader pointed out .
Unfortunately you ca n't sleep in the lobby .
I stay in over 100 nights a year in Starwood hotels around the world and have seen some great Westins .
But this is not one of them .
As such a frequent guest I was put into a handicap accessible room , which means no separate shower , and strobe lights went off in the room when somebody rang my doorbell .
If they treat their best guest this way , imagine what kind of room you 'll get .
No water in the room unlike other Westins .
And the kicker is , when I called down in the morning to request a local newspaper , I was told you can buy it downstairs .
This is the only Westin in the world that does not give you a copy of newspaper to their Starwood Platinum guest .
Truly amazing .
I used to stay here in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , and was always impressed with the hotel .
So I was really looking forward to this return trip in over 10 years .
Unfortunately so much has changed .
This hotel has past its prime .
I quickly cancelled my 6 - night stay the following month .
I think at the Park Hyatt they understand the value of a returning guest .
You can find better options in San Francisco .
Great little budget gem .
More than adequate for the price , especially in San Francisco .
Clean , comfortable , and spacious with helpful and friendly staff .
Bathroom was cold when showering because the fan runs all the time .
Did not find it noisy ( had requested upstairs room , as per tripadvisor advice ) .
Great diner for breakfast around the corner if continental is not enough for you .
Not great . . .
We booked an executive room as it was n't too much more to get the little bit of extra space .
Well , I 'd have hated to see what the smaller rooms looked like as ours was n't huge - we were n't falling over things but it was n't what I would call spacious .
We checked in and whilst the room itself was quite nice , the bathroom was really very basic and a little bit grotty - the sink was cracked , the bath looked very old . . . . so I went to reception and told them I did n't really expect to find a cracked sink and did they have another room .
We were shown another room , and although the sink was newer , it was all just a little too basic - the sort of thing I might expect to find in a youth hostel but not in a hotel charging decent prices .
I told the hotel I was n't happy and they tried to find us alternative accommodation in a sister hotel but the rooms in those hotels were tiny , so we checked out and went to stay at the JW Marriott round the corner , which was streaks nicer , for about $ 20 more a night .
I had had high hopes for the Rex based on the website and the reviews but to be honest , in the flesh , it just was n't that great and not quite the sort of ' boutique ' hotel I had been led to expect .
Although my experience of the rooms was n't great , the staff were very helpful and did n't charge us for the first night which was very decent of them .
TripAdvisor comes through .
What a great find !
View from Room
Great Hotel ! !
We recently spent 3 nights at the Tuscan .
Nice , medium sized hotel in a good location .
Walking distance to all Fishermans 's Wharf attractions , cable cars , etc .
Very good Italian resturant attached ( forgot the name ) .
Wine tastings each afteroon .
The staff is friendly and helpful .
The room is medium size , clean and comfortable .
I SUGGEST YOU REQUEST A COURTYARD ROOM TO AVOID THE STREET NOISE .
This IS a city !
Not a Bad on a Budget .
Normally I am a princess when it comes to staying in hotels ; nothing short of luxury creeps me out .
However , I was on a budget , and so I chose to stay at the Castle because of the rave reviews for this budget motel .
I was n't unimpressed , but I was n't impressed either .
The staff was extremely accommodating , and the parking was free , even after we checked out , which is huge in SF .
The rooms were clean and comfortable , meaning I was n't creeped out .
Still , I knew I was staying in far less than a luxury hotel .
But , if you are on a budget , The Castle is not a bad choice . ( And centrally located )
Great location , but disappointing .
Location is this hotel 's best feature - could n't be better .
We had a large , light corner room in the old section .
However , the overall condition of the hotel was rather shabby - dim , poorly furnished lobby , paint and wallpaper peeling off the wall of our room , hooks in the bathroom falling out of the wall ( and then just left there by the maid for 2 days ) , no light , paper or pen on the desk , no information about the hotel amenities ( no pool ? ! )
other than we had to pay $ 12 / day per person to use the gym .
The amenities are nicer at the Holiday Inn Express in any podunk town in America .
Too bad , because this is a beautiful landmark hotel .
Best Little Hotel in SF .
This is the second year my friend and I have stayed at this hotel .
We absolutely love it for it location and incredible cleanliness .
Everything smells and looks clean .
The people that work there are very friendly and helpful .
We will always stay there when we go to SF !
Good Stay .
Nice hotel close to the action ; however , I did not like the location - while it was close to the Wharf , the area of the hotel was seedy .
If I were to return I would try downtown and take public transportation to Fisherman 's Wharf .
value for money - couple from Galway , Ireland .
good value for money , good location , helpful staff , large clean room , large bathroom with good water pressure .
however , slight musty smell .
Complimentary breakfast in reception area , must take back to room as no seating area - fruit , juice , muffins , croissants , tea , coffee , enough to keep one going .
Free parking .
Nice eateries on Polk Street ( towards wharf direction - great Thai - Lemongrass , very reasonable .
Also Scomas - great seafood restaurant ( good steak took ) , Pier 41 in to left , towards sea , off the main road .
We hired bikes from Blazzing Saddles and cycled along sea front across Golden Gate Bridge to Sausilito , ( all down hill from bridge ) came back by ferry as too steep to cycle back .
Thoroughly enjoyed the trip , took about 1hr 15 mins .
A warm fleece or jacket is need in SF in late Sept / early Oct .
We spent 3 weeks driving from LA to San Fran ( up Highway 1 ) to Death Valley via Yosemite and onto Las Vegas .
We then flew to New York to stay with family for 2 nights before heading home .
The following is a list of where we stayed quick commentsLA - Hollywood Celebrity Hotel - great location , basic but great value . -
2 nightsSanta Barbara - Cheshire Cat Inn - excellent overall , not too expensive - 1 night - loved the town .
San Luis Obispo - Petit Soleil B B - excellent overall - not too expensive - 1 night - nice town .
Monterey penninsula - Old Monterey Inn - better than excellent but expensive , - very romantic - 2 nights - lovely area especially if one is into golf as we are - Pebble Beach - wow !
San Fran - Nob Hill Motor Inn - good location , basic but great value .
Yosemite Nat Park - Ahwahnee Hotel - excellent but expensive , romantic - 2 nights .
Lone Pine - Dow Villa Motel - good value , 1 night , on hind sight no need to stay here , could have driven from Ahwahnee to Furnace Creek in Death Valley without breaking the journey with an overnighter here .
Could just have stopped for dinner at the Merry Go Round restaurant .
Death Valley - Furnace Creek Ranch ( Inn not open ) - no real options in DV , 1 nightLas Vegas - The Orleans Hotel - off strip , shuttle every 15 mins , took about 7 mins - fantastic value - 3 nights .
See separate reviews also , have listed as above because a lot of people seem to do this trip and if we had come across something like this initially , it would have taken us a fraction of the time to put the trip together .
Previous reviews by owners / managers ? !
Not the reality that I experienced !
I was there last weekend , my fourth visit in a years time .
Three previous stays were for business trips .
Yes , the Castle Inn is centrally located and has off - street parking .
But , the clientele being catered to has DRASTICALLY changed !
The new , evidently preferred customer is the party all night and urinate off the balcony crowd .
Literally .
The owners / managers were certainly mum on any behavior or guest management efforts , even bragging that these same guests were back out drinking on the sidewalks at 8am the next morning .
Just what a business customer or traveling couple wants to hear ? Definitely not .
Drug store earplugs and a fan running on high did not drown the night - long parties .
Definitely not the experience I expected or paid for !
If money is your only concern and you do n't mind lodging with hooligans for neighbors , this is your place .
Avoidable but for the location .
To start with the good things . . .
in fact perhaps the only good thing . . . .
the location of this hotel is really nice !
On the Union Square right near the Macy 's and otehr shops etc . !
Regarding the other stuff . .
the hotel is really run down , the rooms and lobby badly need a renivation . . . the staff a lot of training !
Go there if you must only for the location but for all else look elsewhere !
Great hotel .
I thought the Hotel Rex was charming .
My room was large with two double beds .
I enjoyed the book - themed ambience .
Even though I arrived too late for the complimentary wine hour , the front desk told me I could go the first floor lounge / bar if I still wanted it .
The central location and free wireless internet access were also pluses .
I 'd definitely stay there again .
Lovely place to stay .
This was the first stop on our road trip of California .
This hotel was very impressive - from the staff at the front door to the free wine tasting sessions .
The rooms were very quirky - the theme making the room a lot more interesting .
The rooms were also quite big .
On the first night we ate in the restaurant in the hotel and they were very friendly and helped explain the menu to us .
The only thing that very a bit too expensive was the valet car parking as the hotel is right on the fishermans warff .
Also - whilst having a room with a view may be nice - the fogg is soooooo dense that you might not even see the bridge at all .
We cycled to the bridge and did n't see it until we were almost on it .
When we went over the bridge we could n't see anything !
If you can afford to stay here then do .
you wo n't regret it .
Becks
One night at the Chancellor .
Stayed in the Chancellor for a stopover night .
Wanted to get some quick shopping in and figured where better to stay than the heart of the city ?
Close to everything , Union Square views , cable cars outside the door , 5 minutes walk to Market Street .
Excellent location .
The rooms are clean and well presented and while not huge are more than adequate for a couple .
We got moved from the second floor to the 4th floor because of the hum of the air - con units outside the window .
Would n't have bothered me , but my light - sleeping missus was n't having any of it .
A quick call to Reception and we were shown 3 other rooms to take a choice from !
Room 406 is beside the fire escape to the rear and was pretty quiet - my missus was well happy !
Result .
Argo - NOT .
You can see where you have to kneel to see the mirror
Great Location but . . .
