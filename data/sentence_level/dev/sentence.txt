Loved the Monte Carlo .
We stayed at the Monte Carlo for 3 nights prior to boarding a cruise ship on November 16 .
We found the service to be excellent - front desk staff very helpful in pointing out the best way to tour Barcelona .
The room was spacious , clean , and comfortable .
We had a sitting room as well as a balcony overlooking Las Rambla .
Because of the double doors on the balcony , the room was quiet .
The buffet breakfast contained a lot of food but not all to our tastes .
It was convenient , as we found no other full breakfast restaurants in the area .
The free use of the computer in the hotel lobby was a nice surprise .
We would definitely book at this hotel again !
Great Reccomendation .
Stayed at this hotel on the strength of reviews of Trip Advisor .
The location was excellent , the staff friendly and the rooms were modern and very clean .
The one slight , and I mean slight , downside was that the sound proofing was not great .
Our room was just beside the lift and we knew when other guests were coming and going .
The pool was a great facility and breakfast was substantial .
Would definitely stay there again
All style and no substance .
I stayed in the Majestic with my boyfriend in mid - December and the hotel is beautiful and very centrally located to the Passeg de Gracia metro stop .
The metro is very easy to use once you get the hang of it and we bought a 10 journey travel card with our debit card and once I had used it to go through the barrier I passed it to my boyfriend to use and it was so easy .
Now the hotel itself - beautiful lobby and clean although we found the general atmosphere a bit formal and stuffy for 2 young people in our 20 's and this alone would put us off returning again .
We would stay in a more relaxed , welcoming hotel in future .
There are no tea + coffee making facilities in the room which I have had in all hotels in various cities I have stayed in before and was a big disappointment considering the rates the hotel charges .
We were in a room which must have been the smallest room I have ever stayed in you literally walked 3 paces from the bed and were in the bathroom . It was clean and comfortable but far too small for the rates they charge .
The minibar as expected was absolutely extortionate and if you go to a supermarket on the Ramblas called Carrefour you can stock up on the same brand of water the hotel puts in the minibar .
Hotel cost per bottle - 4 euro carrefour cost - 21 cents .
You do the maths .
I feel with this hotel you are simply paying for the name .
Great short break hotel .
Just returned from 5 day break staying at the Barcelona Universal Hotel with 4 friends ( all over 40 ! ) .
Our rooms were spotlessly clean and staff were very friendly and helpful .
We loved the substantial breakfast - chocolate cheesecake for breakfast was a first !
On the roof there is a VERY small pool and a few loungers for relaxing after a long day sightseeing , with fabulous views of the city .
Only 10 mins walk from Ramblas though the walk there seemed to pass the edge of the red light district but a metro station outside the front door made travel easy .
We got 2 day tickets for the tourist bus which covers all the main attractions and gives you a book of tickets for discounted entrance to most museums and galleries .
We had a brilliant time and would definately use this hotel again .
We booked through octopus travel . com and got a good deal .
A hotel that needs more attention to detail .
This is a man 's hotel , and not women friendly .
The city 's most expensive restaurant reeks of cigars , and the rooms need to be aired out .
Small details like bathrobes that are soft and comfortable , kleenex in the room , plugs for laptops in the desks , alarm clocks , doors that do not slam shut with incredible noise , and sound - proofing would be useful .
As well , the water supply of the city of Barcelona requires visitors to have spring water , this was not provided or even easily available .
Heating and air - conditioning are very uneven and can not be controlled .
The pool on the roof is laughable - it is exactly 12 feet by six feet and unheated .
They should simply put whirlpool jets in it and accept the fact that it is nothing more than a big bathtub .
The roof also is unsafe for children as it has no safety rails and a very large drop down .
While the staff of this hotel are very nice , the lack of attention to detail means this is no more than a businessman 's hotel for very short stays , and the fact that at least half the rooms have a terrible view of a concrete carpark is another consideration .
Breakfast is not included , is eaten in the basement and is 26 Euros .
There are no no - smoking areas in the hotel .
Excellent modern hotel in an excellent location .
Hotel turns out to be just as all the previous reviews have said - the goods and the bads .
Good location close to but far enough from busy tourist areas , subway station right at door , good restaurants / cafes nearby , noisy main street , modern room and lobby , competitive rates compared with other hotels - good value for money .
A laundry shop in the backlane of the hotel washes a bag of your clothes for 10 Euros that opens 9 - 1 and 4 - 8 .
I suspect the hotel itself sends its washings to the shop too - do n't quote me on that : )
Terrible Service .
We booked a long weekend at the Grand Marina and on arrival were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms .
Very modern with a seperate lounge area and comfortable .
The rooms were spacious and everything was fine .
The problems started when we went to check out on the final day .
We had a flight booked at 8pm on the Sunday and so , wanting to enjoy our final day in the city , checked out and left our bags with the concierge .
He presented us with a ticket for the bags and off we went for lunch .
On our return , we presented the ticket and expected to get our bag .
The concierge could not find our bag and a phonecall soon after confirmed that a gentleman at Barcelona airport had found our bag in the boot of his taxi when he got to the airport .
The only option had been for him to ask the taxi driver to return the case to the hotel .
Honesty in Barcelona is not a strong quality and the bag had never arrived back at the Grand Marina .
We were getting nowhere with the management of the hotel who clearly did not care and so that we did not miss our flight , we left for the airport empty handed with the promise of an explaination from the manager the following day .
Back in the UK we made a claim with our insurers but needed to get confirmation from the hotel of the events that took place .
We made call after call to the hotel who would never allow me to speak with the manager .
I emailed the hotel asking for confirmation and again received nothing .
All in all the service after the loss , for which they were responsible was awful .
In the end , I managed to get a friend who was working in Barcelona to visit the hotel in person and stand over the manager whilst he wrote an email confirming events .
If I had not had this friend do this , I would never have got the claim through .
In summary , whilst the hotel is well positioned and the rooms are lovely , the service and attitude of the staff and management is appalling .
Good experience .
Hotel was as advertised : stylish , well located right off the Placa de Catalunya , comfortable .
Lazy , poor service .
This hotel is beautiful and the location is wonderful .
The views from all rooms are unparalleled since this is one of the tallest buildings in the city .
The rooms are nice and the linens on the beds are very comfortable .
The service at the hotel is appalling and no amount of asking for help actually produced results .
Some examples of basic requests that we were never able to get during our fours days there : having the room cleaned every day , having a coffee maker in the room ( that was supposed to be there already ) , asking for a do not disturb on our telephone line as we tried to sleep of jet - lag ( they would do it for outside callers but the mini - bar people and other staff would ring any way ) .
We had also asked ahead of time for reservations in the restaurants in the hotel , were ignored and then not given much help in finding places to dine .
The airlines delayed our luggage and even when it was finally delivered to the hotel , they did n't give it to us .
When we insisted on seeing their luggage room ( since the airline claimed they had delivered it ) they did admit they had bags they could n't identify .
The bags had our names six places on the outside and two on the inside .
There is no gift shop in the hotel where you can buy even the most basic toiletries and no help from the staff getting so much as an extra tube of shampoo .
I can not agree more with the Trip advisor member from Manchester .
Hotel is deficient in every sense and every way . . .
Great Hotel . . .
Stayed here for a couple of nights on the way back from Ibiza .
Great room , we had a ' Designo ' double as there were no suites availble , but the r0om was excellent , as were the desk staff .
No bar as such in the hotel but it 's right on the Ramblas so this is n't really an issue .
Only ( very slight ) blight on the two nights was the grumpy little fellow who brought our wine to the room !
Nowhere near 5 stars .
Stayed for one night and that was more than enough .
The shower was cold and the hydrobath did n't work .
The breakfast from room service that was charged at 93 EUROS ! ! ! ! ! was cold and had to be sent back .
There was a nightclub under our room which played music that got louder as the night went on and did n't end until after 4am .
The night staff 's response was to ask us if we wanted to move rooms when I complained at 1 . 30am and told us not to worry it would be over by 3am .
Worst of all was the complete lack of interest when we complained to the staff .
The hotel might look impressive but the management and staff are obviously lacking the knowledge , experience and frankly the effort to make this a 5 star experience for their guests .
Very mixed feelings .
This is place is far overpriced !
And beside the spectacular prices , they charge you for basically ANYTHING else . . . . . . and they know their prices .
Be prepared to pay 4 Euro for an in - room coffee made yourself by the coffeemaker in the room ( and then add the tax to it ) or 7 Euro for a coke taken from you minibar ( again without the tax ) .
Anything room service brought to the room will be applicable to a 6 euro delivery charge on top of the already high prices .
Just to give you an idea !
At these rates you would expect it to be flawless . But it 's far from that .
When we arrived in the room the toilet was far from clean and contained stains of sh t from the previous guest .
We immediately called the manager on duty who , after 25 minutes , arrived to the room .
He acted shocked and advised to send housekeeping right away .
This took another 30 minutes and when the girl left , nothing was changed .
Again we called the manager and came up to the room with the Head Housekeeping .
Naturally both were shocked and housekeeping was called again .
Then things were cleaned as they were supposed to !
As a gesture for the inconvenience we received a dinner for two !
And that 's where the hotel came in place for it 's 5 star status .
The food all over the hotel is simply great . From dinner to breakfast . Absolutely great quality .
Be also aware that the hotel is extremely noisy .
Being on the 25th floor , we still hear traffic and people partying on the beach for almost the whole night .
All in all a disappointing experience and not something we would consider a second time !
Not a 5 Star Hotel .
This is the first time I have ever posted a review , but I have to share my experiences of staying at this hotel with others so you do n't experience the difficulties we encountered .
I normally write off bad reviews I read as whinging hard to please pedants , but this is written in the hope that it is helpful information for anyone seeking to book a quality hotel in Barcelona .
I booked a late long weekend break at the end of January and booked two rooms for 3 nights at the Grand Marina .
There were actually 5 of us staying including my 3 children ( youngest is 9 ) , but the website - similar to most - could n't cope with booking a family of 5 .
I therefore called the hotel after booking and explained that there was an additional child and I was happy to pay the extra charge involved .
I would have booked direct with the hotel but their website does not feature their telephone number ( ! ) and would not accept an e - mail .
When we arrived late on Friday our rooms were not interconnecting , even though the hotel was almost empty and interconnecting rooms must have been available .
On the Saturday I decided to check exactly how much they were adding onto the Bill for my ' extra ' child so I had no nasty surprises at checkout .
It worked out twice what I was paying as an adult .
I queried this and the Duty Manager agreed to a small reduction , but still I was paying more for an extra ' Z Bed ' stuck in one of our rooms than for my own stay .
This hotel definitely does not want kids .
It 's a business travellers hotel , as witnessed by the bizarrely expensive minibar prices only to be tolerated if on expenses .
Please do n't think I 'm stingy - I do n't mind paying for quality - but this is a 3 to 4 star hotel masquerading as 5 star because the building looks good .
The pool was closed , the view was of cargo ships being unloaded ( which continued noisily overnight ) rather than the sea and the staff at reception were less helpful than a famous Torquay guest house .
On checkout I asked whether they could advise what times the buses left for Gerona airport as my flight was at 10 . 30pm .
I was made to feel like I was being a nuisance and was told that the last flight from that airport was 8 . 30pm so I should get a bus around 6 . 00pm .
I checked my ticket and the flight was later as I thought , so we carried on without their uninformed guesswork .
Comapre this to the last time I stayed in Barcelona , at the Neri Hotel ( 4 star not 5 ) where the staff printed out a bus timetable from the internet for me and could not have been more helpful .
It was an appropriate end to a generally poor hotel experience .
Thankfully Barcelona itself more than made up for the over - priced and under - delivering Grand Marina .
My daughter did have her bag stolen in the city , but at least the thieves involved in that instance do n't call themselves 5 star .
If you 're planning to stay in Barcelona , take it from me , there are much better 4 star hotels than the Grand Marina at around the same price or less - I 'm only sorry we did n't stay in one .
Beautiful Hotel .
My wife and I stayed at the Arts for 3 nights in a club room .
The hotel is very stylish with beautiful interiors and stunning flower and fruit arrangements throughout .
The bedroom was very spacious and stylishly furnished with a huge bed and fabulous linens .
There was also a fantastic Bang Olufsen flat screen TV and sound system .
The bathrooms are very smart with separate WC and huge walk in shower as well as 2 basins and a bath .
Massive white towels , everything you would expect from a deluxe hotel .
Most criticism on the site seems to be about the level of service .
Here are some of our experiences , the hotel pre booked all our dinner reservations prior to our arrival at some of the city 's top restaurants .
The night we arrived we had to change plans on an ongoing basis as my wife 's flight was severely delayed ( we were travelling from different cities ) meaning our original dinner plans had to be abandoned .
The girls in the club lounge looked after all of this ( whilst I was reading a book and enjoying a free glass of wine or two ! ) and when my wife finally arrived Bites had been kept open so that we could eat there .
The service was perfect and for people who complain about the price of everything , I do not think Euro90 over the top for two main courses , a bottle or wine , a couple of bottles of water and coffees .
These are normal deluxe hotel charges .
The following morning we were greeted in the lounge by name and enjoyed a very pleasant breakfast .
After a day 's sightseeing we again used the lounge facilities pre dinner .
A well stocked bar and different types of food depending on the time of day are always available .
The lounge staff worked out which bars in the city would be showing the rugby world cup semi finals for us to watch on the Saturday and generally helped whenever they could . The level of service continued like this throughout .
That is about all really apart from the say the longest we waited for a lift was one minute and our room was on the 32nd floor .
Great Hotel ! !
We went to Barcelona for our wedding anniversary .
We chose this hotel after reading the reviews on here and were not disappointed .
The location is excellent right on La Rambla , but the rooms ( or at least our room ) are still very quiet , we could n't hear the street at all .
We paid extra for a " deluxe " room which was a bit smaller than I was expecting , but still very nice with everything you needed .
The spa area was also very good with a small pool , jacuzzi ' s , sauna and steam room .
This was great after a busy day sightseeing .
I would definitely recommend this hotel .
Ideal .
We found the hotel to be very good overall .
Staff friendly and attentive .
Room was excellent overlooking the inner harbour and as we were on the 7th floor , we did not experience too much noise etc from the cruise ships and ferries .
However a room overlooking the Trade Centre would probably have put a completely different slant on things .
Breakfast was excellent with just about most things you could want and as it is buffet style , you simply have as much as you want from a very comprehensive choice .
Other than breakfast we did not eat in the hotel , preferring to explore the city .
The evening menu did not look particularly exciting in terms of choice but neither was it that expensive .
Probably similar prices to many of the restaurants in the city .
It is not too far a walk to Las Ramblas , the centre of much of the city 's evening activity with the benefit of when you get back to the hotel , you are away from all the hustle , bustle and noise of the city .
We would definitley stay there again .
Excellent value and quality .
We stayed here for 3 nights 26th - 29th Jan and were very pleasantly surprised at the great quality of everything in this hotel .
Everything is spotless and well maintained and the staff are very helpful .
The thing that shocked us most was how reasonable the prices were for this standard of hotel .
Dublin and the Costas in Spain could learn a thing or two about ripping people off .
The room service menu and minibar charges are excellent .
3 euro for a beer / vodka and 8 euro for a deluxe burger with all the trimmings delivered to your room ! I call that value !
The room was very stylish and a good size with a very comfortable bed !
Hi Fi and large screen TV , bathrobes and slippers all very nice quality .
Great bathroom with twin sinks and a speaker from whichever device you have on in the bedroom .
All in all the nicest hotel I have stayed in and at 拢65 BB a steal .
As Arnie says I ` ll be back !
Love the Hotel , give Barcelona a miss .
We stayed here for five nights in early July .
We 'd booked a double room but they did n't have one when we arrived . We had to change rooms the next day , which was a little frustrating .
Overall we had no problems with the hotel , the rooms were very nice , the staff were helpful and spoke excellent English and the breakfasts were more than adequate .
The hotel is right next to the metro station but it is only a five minute walk to La Rambla .
We enjoyed Barcelona , especially the Gaudi , BUT we had a bag stolen whilst sat in the Parc de la Ciutadella .
Whilst reporting this at the police station we met another couple who had their bag taken in exactly the same place .
We passed this police station every day and it was amazing how many tourists were in there , at all times of the day - there is definitely a crime wave going on .
If you do go , and we wo n't be going back , please be very careful .
We were luckly and did n't lose any valuables but the other couple lost everything .
And we were very careful , they are just extremely clever - we were distracted for no more than 10 seconds !
Overpriced .
I had originally booked the Hotel Arts for our 3 night stay in Barcelona for our wedding anniversary .
Upon reading the reviews and seeing the location of Arts , I cancelled this booking to stay at 1898 .
What a mistake .
The cost was about the same , ( 370 Euros a night for a bedroom with terrace at 1898 ) .
Paying this sort of money , I expected , rightly or wrongly so , to have some sort of standard of service .
How wrong we were .
We arrived to be told that there were no irons and ironing boards allowed in the rooms , that they were a ' risk ' , so if you wanted anything to be ironed , you had to pay for laundry ( I am surprised no one else noted this ? ) .
The luggage we brought along would have cost well over 100 Euros to be ironed . How ridiculous .
So we nipped to Carrefour next door and got a travel iron ! ! ! !
Not exactly what I had in mind for our special break ! ! ! ! !
The room ( 532 I think it was ) was smaller than I imagined it would be , spotlessly clean I hasten to add , with a nice private terrace to lounge around in , which I appreciated .
It was nicely decorated , but not at all spacious in size for the price we paid .
The service is what lets this hotel down .
We had problems getting a taxi one night and there were 4 people behind the reception desk doing nothing , whilst the concierge over the road at the Meridien , were hailing every available taxi for their clients . Very irritating .
Also , the service on the roof top terrace was spectacularly awful .
I shouldnt have to send my husband to find a waiter to get us drinks , or have to look at remanants of breakfast left by other guests for half an hour .
The location , la rambla , is awful .
Coming from Amsterdam , this was the worst place for us to be situated .
What a nasty , smelly , crowded tourist hellhole .
We went to Hotel Arts for a drink one lunchtime and I severely regret cancelling that booking .
There were staff everywhere .
Service was efficient and polite and professional .
This was truly a 5 star experience .
I shall be booking there on our next trip for sure .
I can not recommend this hotel to anyone , because I felt it was majorly overpriced for what you get .
Majorly disappointed and not sure why this hotel is number 1 in Barcelona ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
What a great place to stay .
A Love / Hate Relationship .
We chose the Hotel Jazz for our October visit to Barcelona based on its location and the many great reviews on this site .
The location was excellent , the room was modern and clean , the bed was good , and the reception staff friendly and helpful ( except for one icy female staff member ) .
But there were several serious problems .
First , the water was undrinkable , full of chlorine .
When we mentioned this , we were told that everyone in Barcelona drinks bottled water because it always tastes like chlorine .
We had to drag 1 1 / 2 liter bottles of water from a market several blocks away .
For the equivalent of 25 cents a bottle , a hotel of this caliber should provide it to guests .
Second , the two English language TV channels both had terrible reception all during our five night stay .
We were told that it was the fault of the satellite company , but when we moved to a hotel near the airport for the next two nights , the reception was just fine .
Third , the Metro noise was very noticeable on the sixth floor .
For a hotel costing about $ 225 a night including two breakfasts , plus over $ 26 a night for parking , these conditions are unacceptable .
Great location .
We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay at this hotel .
Situated on La Ramblas it was a fab location for visiting the attractions of this wonderful city .
Our room overlooked La Ramblas with a tiny balcony ( wide enough to stand on ! ) . Yes it was quite noisy , but not bad enough to keep us awake , even on the Friday night when the fiesta began !
The room was a reasonable size .
The bed was comfortable .
Tea coffee making facilities available .
The staff were courteous .
Marti on reception ( seemed to be on duty the whole time we were there ) was extremely helpful recommending fabulous restaurants .
The Patagonia is definitely worth a visit - beef to die for !
The roof terrace gave us great views over the city .
The pool is tiny and was very cold at the time of our visit . But plenty of places to sit and relax .
The only downside was the bar prices . . . . . be aware !
We loved Barcelona and will definitely return to this hotel .
Avoid but . . .
The hotel is nice and the spot is ideal : you 're IN the city .
But the service is totally different with so many rooms for improvement it became not acceptable .
Room cleaning was not done at 4:30pm !
Room cleaning involves your active action : there is always something missing !
Spa really need to be cleaned ( avoid the hammam ) .
Breakfast service is unefficient say rude and even if food is abudant , avoid quality .
Do you want an umbrella , they do not have - Do insist : they have some !
And finally , rooms are really noisy !
The price is the one of a 5stars in BCN .
But you pay for the place as the service is an up - 3stars .
Prefer the Neri or Le Méridien or , for excellent service : La Florida or the Arts ( but then forget the city ! ) .
Fantastic hotel .
Like all the other reviews we read , we loved this hotel .
Service was superb and the reception staff were friendly , helpful and great at recommending restaurants to visit in the evenings , they even booked them for us and orgnised taxis .
The reataurant in the hotel was excellent too and very reasonably priced .
The rooms were very cool - a bit like the Morrison Hotel in Dublin , minimalist and chic .
Ca n't wait to go back
Nice , but too many faults .
Spent 5 nights ( in Aug 30 - out Sep 4 ) at bargain rate of approx $ 200 US per night booked on line thru an internet wholesaler .
Arrived very early in AM on the 30th and was told the house was full and check in time was 3PM .
So , we headed for roof top pool deck and hung out and dozed on chaise for a couple of hours .
Around 10AM , we headed down thru lobby and discovered our room was ready .
Having read the Trip Advisor warnings , we asked to see the room before taking our luggage up .
It was 310 , a twin bedded room in the back overlooking a parking lot and some air - conditioning unit .
The front desk said it was a quiet room with lots of light .
We demurred and insisted on a different room ( and overheard others get upgrades at front desk ) - and so we ended up in 729 , with a balcony in front of hotel and a lovely view of Passeig de Gracia .
Nice , light , quiet enough despite vehicle traffic outside .
It was a somewhat painful time - consuming process to obtain an okay room .
The room was smallish , bathroom functional but stonework in need of sprucing up .
Mattress in need of replacement or rotation - I felt I would slide off the bed because the mattress leaned towards the telephone .
Bedding okay - sheets decent enough quality .
Plenty of pillows of different shapes and hardness .
Message light on phone stayed lit for entire stay despite our numerous calls to front desk to address it .
Housekeeping excellent .
Hard finding any English speaking TV stations on the lovely flat screen TV .
Turn down service nice touch .
No noise from hallway .
Elevators ( all sets of them ) - pathetically slow , at times , and small and hot .
Hotel lobby and fancy restaurant undergoing some sort of renovation ( someone said the air conditioning system was being fixed ) .
Breakfast ( included in price ) was served in a conference room on lobby level our first 3 days and then in usual location ( sub - basement level ) last two days .
Nice buffet selection . . .
attentive service .
No complaints .
Free newspapers ( some in English ) .
The hotel has a decent gym area near the pool on roof as well as sauna and steam room .
The sauna and steam can be used only upon payment of fee and with reservation .
Plenty of chaises and chairs on roof , from which you can see Sagrada Familia Church , port , Montjuic - etc etc .
Great views .
The hotel is less than one block from Passeig de Gracia metro station which is very convenient to get down to Ramblas or to Barciloneta ( sic ) or anywhere .
We took a Renfe train from that station to Sitges this past Sunday .
Hotel is okay walk ( slightly downhill ) to Placa Catalon , but you 'll will find the slight street grade incline makes the return walk a bit more grueling .
Hotel was longer walk from Placa Catalon than we would have liked .
Free ice and lemon and lime flavored water available 24 / 7 off lobby , along with red and green apples .
Concierge extremely gracious and generous with time , advice , restaurant recommendations and reservations .
Last night , we had ballet tickets at Liceu and had to depart hotel before Cafe d ' Academia opened and could confirm .
We headed for the popular restaurant after our show ended and , sure enough , hotel had come through with sought after reservation .
Kudos to Concierge Christine and her colleagues .
Despite its many features , I would be inclined to stay in a hotel in the Barri Gotic next time or , much more likely , the fabulous Hotel Arts right on the beachfront in Port Olympic , but a five minute walk from old city .
We toured that hotel , and the rooms and views are impressive .
I feel we got our money 's worth at the Majestic , but only because we landed a terrific internet rate .
Lives up to the hype ! !
My wife and I booked the Hotel Montecarlo for the Barcelona stretch of our honeymoon .
We booked it based on reviews from this website .
We were a little nervous because the hotel is not found on very many travel sites .
Bottom line : the entire experience was unforgettable - because of the room , the staff , the location and the price .
I had written in advance to advise that it was our honeymoon , and they certainly stepped up to the occasion .
They placed us in what they referred to as their newest and best suite .
2nd Floor with a private terrace overlooking La Rambla .
seperate bedroom and sitting room .
Beautiful decor , cozy kingsize bed , and the greatest bathroom you could imagine with a 2 person jacuzzi , huge seperate shower with rainfall , regular detachable showerhead and horizontal hydrotherapy jets !
Double - sink vanity , etc , etc .
Moments after the staff checked us in and brought up our bags , the hotel manager arrived with a complementary bottle of cava ( spanish champagned ) and flowers to congratulate us on the occasion .
After each long , wonderful day we would sit out on our terrace with a bottle of cava and watch the excitment of La Rambla go by .
Then , the moment we closed the well - soundproofed doors lowered the professionally installed black - out blinds , we were in our private villa which could have been miles from any other people .
Seriously folks - This hotel was the highlight of our trip .
It was just Okay .
I stayed here with my boyfriend as part of our trip around London and Barcelona , mainly because of the number of raving reviews .
First I stayed in room 314 , and yes , we heard the rumbling and vibration of the underground train , which stopped around midnight .
Try and get a higher floor .
The bathroom was nice , new , sparkling and clean which was a plus , as I am a cleanfreak .
We desperately needed a converter plug for charging our laptop and we continuously called and asked the front desk about one for the entire duration of our stay ( 3 days ) and the answer each time was that they were all out .
Each time we called it seemed as though someone just got one 20 minutes ago and we were out of luck .
So be sure to bring your own adapters .
We could have bought one from down the street but it just seemed like a waste since we were here for so little .
The beds were n't as soft and comfortable as when we stayed near the ocean in the Arts Hotel ( the first part of our trip ) , and the bedding was just sheets really .
The soundproofing from outside the room was alright , we did n't hear much noise , except when a rally of protestors woke us up at 7am , but otherwise it 's quiet .
The pool closes pretty early , about 7 or 8pm , and so I ca n't say we got to enjoy it , because we spent most of the day out and about the city .
Location - wise it is perfect , it 's right by Las Ramblas and within walking distance of all stores and areas .
While you are there , stop at Farggi 's and have a gelato , it 's really good .
Do n't expect someone to get your bags for you , and there is no concierge .
The english - speaking front desk does most everything , but I guess I caught them in the wrong times because they were n't too friendly or polite .
Overall the hotel is nice . . . yes it is all ' modern ' but if you know anything about construction and materials you can see it 's all cheap decor ( doorframe is a plastic material ) , but if that crap does n't matter to you it should be no problem .
If the price is right then do it .
All in all it was a pleasant and memorable stay , besides the little things mentioned above that was a bit annoying .
this is not the Ritz Carlton .
It could have been so nice , Ritz Carlton standard in a European hotel .
The Ritz - Carlton approach seems to be always a step ahead .
But not here , this was just plain lazy , slow and bad service .
I checked in with 2 friends staying with 3 in the room and although this was in the reservation and I was clearly showing up with total of 3 people , the receptionist gave me a room with one bed .
When I called from the room , the same receptionist had the nerve to question my reservation and whether I was with 1 or 2 other people .
Come on !
Is n't that the Ritz Carlton approach to then just deal with the issue .
Expecting a tip when the room change was eventually made was just an insult .
The rooms are pretentious and boring .
At 7pm I tried to order drinks at the pool but the bar was closed .
The staff could not say another word than closed .
Come on people ? !
Wake up !
After I asked directly , the pool staff would get someone from the bar , but this person never showed up .
When I returned to the room in the middle of the night trying to fall asleep I noticed that the AC was not working .
But at 4 am you dont ask for a room change .
I discussed the matter at check out the next morning and just met stupid arrogance like the systems at this hotel are unbeatable .
As compensation I was not charged for overnight parking , like that would make me feel better .
I am avoiding all Ritz Carltons for the next century and suggest you stay away from this monstrosity in Barcelona .
For half the money you 'll enjoy the real barcelona experience .
Gorgeous but stupid .
What a pity to have such a beautifully designed hotel only to let it rot away in its own filth and fill it with dim staff .
Stayed in a huge corner suite with beautiful views of the sea . . .
if you can get past the dozens of forehead prints in the windows .
The bedding is luxurious but the headboard full of handprints .
The Bathroom very large but is moldy , the marble is unfortunately stained , and the toilet disgustingly dirty upon arrival .
The maid did n't come for the first 3 days of our stay .
We complained over and over again only to have the manager tell us to take it up with Ritz Carleton .
Called the RC group only to be told I should have taken it up with local management .
The pool area was very comfortable with free fruit , thick towels , hanging beds , magazines . . . and nons - stop honking and sirens from the city below .
I was there on a corporate awards event and was surprised to hear that our problems were not isolated or bad luck .
Many people could n't find their maid , and one colleague had a laptop stolen from his room .
The catering of the actual evening events was almost inedible .
I do not recommend this hotel .
A great hotel - - - NOT EVEN CLOSE .
Spent a week at the Arts .
From underwhelming service , to overcrowded elevators to operators sometimes never answering the phones , to night time turn down service happening three of our six nights , to a 45 minute wait for a chair at the pool , to ordering a draft beer ( which cost 11 euro by the way ) at 11AM and STILL never getting it to meeting people who ordered at 20 euro pizza at 1:00 who are still waiting for it to show up . . .
to waiting for an elevator for 10 to 15 minutes at times , THIS IS A POORLY RUN hotel ! !
Some of the staff go out of their way to be wonderful for sure , but the vast majority seem totally overwhelmed by the crowds .
If you have been to other Ritz Carlton properties before , and expect the same experience here , you 're NOT going to get it .
We ran into people in the elevator we did n't even know , and they all said , this hotel sucks .
I would say if you are looking for a deluxe experience in Barcelona . . . look elsewhere .
Tbe rooms did have awesome showers though ! !
Awful area / noisy / bad food / dont believe the other reviews .
This was an awful experience I will never repeat .
I actually checked tripfinder before I went and all the reviews were positive , shame noone told the truth about some factors which were definetely not unique to my stay only .
I feel dutybound to stop you frOm making this mistake .
Firstly the area of this hotel is disgusting .
It is accesible from the airport BUT it is a rundown / dirty / vandalized part of town .
The hotel is completely out of place to its surroundings .
My heart sank .
My room faced the disgusting EXPO hotel , so my view consisted of them sunbathing on the rooftop ( also awful ) of the EXPO .
I asked to be moved and they moved me to floor 6 .
they donwgraded my room without telling me .
I later realised that my new room had no tea making facilities or slippers etc .
My room was so noisy at night as it now faced the main busy at all times road .
it was impossible to sleep .
the windows must have been paper thin .
i was so upset that i asked to be moved again .
This time my room was next door to the noisy laundry room and above a room with a balcony , so i heard the drunken yobs below ( word for word ) conversation until 5a . m .
In between all of this I tried the restaurant .
The view is ok , but the food is not good at all .
the people writing the other reviews have obviosuly not tasted good quality food as this was n't even average .
Let me also tell you that the room service was slow .
The pizza 's tasted like rubber .
Dont use the lounge downstairs , they dont serve you for hours .
Clearly customer service is not a strong priority .
breakfast IS not included in price .
DONT PAY FOR THIS .
It is far too expensive and the range is completely minimal .
jsut cant believe it was a cold breakfast .
The management did move me to different rooms on 3 occasions , thats one move per night since i began my stay .
its a shame they did n't value my custom enough to consider moving me to a slightly less noisy room . thats all i asked for .
I ended up losing money on , my flight coz i returned home early , i booked out on 3rd night and went back to uk .
This was the worst 4 star ever .
Dont book it .
It is a complete waste .
I relied on trip finder reviews .
None of them mentioned the awful area and bad service and food .
I have stayed in many hotels worldwide and this was the worst .
I hardly ever complain and they brought out the worst in me .
In short - unless you book a very high room ( floor 23 ) you hear the yraffic noise .
The higher rooms costs more .
For the price and area they should include breakfast at least .
Nosiy / bad service / bad area / bad staff .
Expecting too much ?
After reading all the eulogistic reviews of the Hotel Montecarlo , perhaps we were expecting a little too much of this good ( but not fantastic ) hotel .
We came away a little deflated but well rested after a 3 night stay .
Firstly , the positives - The frontdesk staff were attentive , helpful and knowledgable .
The room was clean ( but see other comments later ) , the towels and robes very comfortable and the jacuzzi bath good fun .
The adjustable bed was very good for elevating the feet after a long walking day .
The hotel 's position halfway along La Rambla is perfect .
Now the disappointments - The room ( 403 ) was very small with no dressing table nor mirror , except in the bathroom where it was regularly steamed up .
Tea / coffee making facilities would have been nice also .
The carpet was very badly marked and stained including several cigarette burns .
The furniture was cheap , shoddy and likewise stained .
Our window view was of a blank wall 10m away .
We asked to be moved and offered to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was full .
We paid 190 Euros for the room per night directly booked with the hotel .
The bar was very basic , lacked comfort and atmosphere .
It was rarely staffed so you had to interupt the frontdesk for service .
Here I admit to being ultra - critical and this probably does n't matter to most people .
However , we like to have a relaxing glass of beer or wine at the end of the day and in the evenings .
All in all it was a fairly pleasant place to stay ( no better than that ) and a deluxe room , rather than basic , is definately recommended .
Horrible horrible horrible service , great view , would n't send my worst enemy .
Dirty , two sorts of staff , Mildly disinterested or downright offensive , for Euro 2000 a night we stupidly expected someone might carry our bags , the shower might work and there would n't be a pile of dirty dishes in the room - the apartment suites are very tired , quite grubby and deafeningly noisy .
turn down service only works on the day you arrive , breakfast sucks , the doormen run away if you 're lucky enough to make eye contact , and complaints are dismissed with fairly brutal accusations of lying .
The Butler who greeted us on arrival , 04 / 10 , Peter , marvellous friendly helpful - though unable to lift bags - after that the unemployable took over - there are several much better places to stay in Barcelona , including the benches in the railway station .
Do n't stay here if you are British ! ! ! !
Although the bathrooms are nice , the rooms are very average and the staff here are overtly anti - British .
They made it abundantly clear ( by way of deferential service and snide remarks / glances ) that they preferred Spaniards over British clients .
If you are not Spanish , then do n't even think about staying here ( unless you enjoy feeling like an unwelcome guest ) .
Service is a fine art at Hotel Arts .
Upon my arrival , the bell captain swiftly removed the luggage from the taxi and whisked it away .
One enters a small lobby with two sofas , and a wonderful French delicatessen , " Hediard " .
Two lifts lead into the main lobby of the hotel .
The reception area is stylish , if a little bland and international , a frosted glass chandelier looking most out of place .
Receptionist was swift and efficient , and obliged my request for a sea view room ( having only reserved a city view ) on a high floor .
To access the rooms , one leaves the lobby down a passageway which has various vases and cut flowers decorating it , to yet another lobby housing the six lifts .
Lifts are lined in a burr wood , with the only mirrors being the doors .
The corridors leading to the bedrooms are a little bland , lifted only by the occasional painting .
The bedroom comprised a small lobby with two double ( single hanging ) wardrobes , which led into a very long , but rather narrow room with a marvellous " wide screen " picture window with views over the pool , marina , and ocean beyond .
The bathroom , to my surprise , felt rather dated , with peachy cream sanitary - ware .
No Bulgari toiletries ( as noted in other reviews ) , but ones created " exclusively for Hotel Arts " by some squiggled signatured company in " Hong Kong and New York " .
That said , they were of a relatively good standard .
The bathtub was long and wide , but took a terribly long time to fill to a suitable depth .
A toilet and bidet were contained in a screened off area , as was the shower cubicle .
Unfortunately , as I was to discover , the seal on the shower door was n't as flush / tight as it should have been .
The combination of two side jets and one fixed head led to one finding the entire bathroom flooded upon exiting the shower .
I wondered whether , perhaps , I had left the door slightly ajar , however , when the bathroom was flooded yet again on the next day , I realised it was the seal at fault .
The staff were very quick in mopping up the soaking floor , and replacing the towels that I had used in an effort to dry the floor .
The bed was comfortable , but still had old fashioned sheets , not a more modern duvet .
The control panel ( for speakers , blind , and lights ) beside the bed which incorporated an alarm clock was a very well thought out feature .
One could wake up and at the touch of a button be greeted by ocean views !
The Bang Olufsen stereo was sadly not supplemented by speakers of comparable quantity , those provided were a little feeble and lacking depth of sound - a shame to waste such a great system on them .
The television was a little awkwardly placed if one had wanted to watch it in bed .
No video library rendered the thoughtfully provided VCR useless - does one really travel with video cassettes ?
DVDs perhaps , but not videos !
A previous reviewer had commented on the " cheap " fitted furniture .
In fact , it is cleverly designed laminated furniture so as to blend in with the wallpaper , and not become a feature in itself .
All cupboards were well lit .
An iron was provided in the room , along with an ironing board , something I find a little strange for a deluxe property .
There were other American school touches like this throughout the entire hotel , nothing wrong , just a little out of place .
The gardens were small , but well landscaped and incorporating terraces for bars , restaurants and a pool deck .
The pool was ludicrously small for such a large property , the sun loungers started to free up in the late afternoon .
Pool staff did not speak English of any standard - they did not understand when asked for " towels " even when coupled with a drying gesture .
Loungers were available in single or double sizes , and some had " tents " enveloping them , presumably for those who prefer the shade .
Complimentary bottles of chilled water , and apples were available , and even sun lotion and champagne at extra cost .
The lobby area behind the reception contained a small lounging area filled with sofas , deep seated leather chairs and a selection of coffee table books about fashion , architecture and travel .
Lemon and minted water was provided in large jugs in the centre of this room .
Off of here was a restaurant - a small menu , with lighter dishes that sounded very sickly .
On the opposite side was a breakfast room cum lounge , containing more low sofas and deep chairs .
A gas fire burnt night and day to serve as a focal point .
In the summer this seems ridiculous , style for style 's sake , some function and logic would have been much appreciated .
This room led into the bar , a small room with yet more low chairs and banquettes decorated with black and white photography of the Marx brothers .
A small " walk - in " humidor in one corner with the bar running along the length of the room .
Drinks were steeply , and irregularly priced .
A mojito ( well made , and a generous size ) was priced the same as a champagne cocktail at 16EUR - fine for the latter , but too much for the former .
Martinis were all 13EUR .
It seemed as if they had been rather lazy and thoughtless in pricing the drinks , almost with the attitude " if you can afford to stay here , anything goes " Service was prompt and efficient .
I will note that the cigars were all cheaper than if shop bought in the UK , but I imagine this is something more to do with duty / taxes rather than the hotel 's generosity .
The restaurant where one took a buffet breakfast ( the name has recently changed and is no longer that advertised in the room ) had a large terrace with equally large and cumbersome pieces of wooden furniture .
Service , as in the bar , was prompt and efficient , copious amounts of fresh orange juice , and good quality ( but by no means the best ) coffee was offered by waitresses who continually swanned around .
The buffet itself has the usual breads , fruits and pastries .
Most notable were the bagels ( another American touch ) , Moet et Chandon champagne , and fresh strawberries with cream that were provided . 25EUR + 7 % tax seems relatively good value when compared to other dining options at this property .
I took breakfast on three out of five mornings , whilst it is not the best hotel breakfast I 've had , it is one of the best , certainly recommended .
I should also point out that the restaurant offers an la carte breakfast menu , but after one would 've ordered orange juice and coffee , it is more cost effective to have had the buffet and had only a few things .
Arola had an excellent menu , however , on the evening I had decided to try it , I was informed ( in the morning ) that it was fully booked .
If I had known it would be so popular I would 've booked it upon my arrival , I feel that the receptionist should have not overlooked this when checking me into the hotel , at the very least there should be a note in the room advising very early booking .
Instead I dined at the main restaurant ( Enoteca Bombasti - or words to that effect ! ) .
Again I noted the weird pricing system .
Starters ranged in price from 10EUR - 28EUR ( excluding caviar ) , and main / fish courses from 18 - 32EUR .
The starters seem overpriced , and the main courses slightly underpriced , this is inconsequential , but looks strange on the menu .
Food was well presented , if a little sickly at times , but all in all , an enjoyable meal .
The poolside restaurant was very casual , and offered a light menu , pizzas , grilled meats , and suchlike ; it was also of an equally high standard , with efficient and courteous service .
I did not take any other meals at the hotel , but it all seemed to be pretty international fare .
Service was very American styled : " It is my pleasure , have a nice day " , which was polite , if rather insincere , but this can not really be criticised .
The concierge was excellent , pointing out various places of interest and locating them on a map , as well as shopping suggestions - they can not be blamed for Barcelona 's lack of quality shopping .
When I requested the room to be serviced within the hour , they obliged , with smiles on their faces .
As a last note , the hotel lacked atmosphere , this was due to the guests staying there .
Mainly brash Britons from Essex ( read Louis Vuitton obsessives ) , and various sections of American society ; ranging from older people " on vacation " to terribly green corporate types ; one man asked his colleague , after touching his trousers " are they wool " followed by , " am I dressed okay ? "
how green !
During the day people walked around the lobby in sandals , and shorts , which is acceptable given the casual and resort nature of the hotel .
However , at 11PM I do not expect to see people walking barefoot ( mainly Americans I am afraid ) though the hotel .
There was no grand or even stylish atmosphere , the hotel had a rather too corporate emphasis on things .
If I were to return to the city ( which I wo n't be ) I would stay there again as it was such a relief to escape the madness of the city centre and walk along the pleasant ( if corpse like ) beach .
Overall , a great place to stay .
We stayed here for two nights , either side of one night in Perpignan , and were overall very satisfied with the place .
The price ( EU . 101 ) per night was excellent value for money , compared with many equivalent hotels .
The staff were helpful and friendly , the rooms and bathrooms were clean , well maintained and it was in short walking distance to Las Ramblas and the main tourist drag . ( Limited ) Parking is available underneath the hotel .
It 's a very inconspicuous entrance so do n't miss it ( like we did . . . ) or you 'll end up doing a big loop ( like we did . . . )
Parking costs about EU . 21 per night , which is a bit steep but not unexpected , and you will need to check availability first .
The view from our first room was ok , 6th floor view onto the main street below .
The second room at the back of the hotel was not so good , a decent sized balcony but looking straight into the backs of residential apartments .
As we were on a four man boys weekend away , such things did n't really matter , but if I were to have gone with my wife and son , I would probably have asked if another room was available .
The swimming pool on the roof is a gem , only small , but a good place to chill out , and the views of Barcelona are fantastic .
We did n't sample the breakfast , so ca n't comment on the food .
Over , I would recommend this as a place to stay if visiting this great city .
Barcelonas Best .
Although it has been eight months since my wife and I have stayed at this hotel I would just like to add my opinion of this fine establishment .
It has one of the friendliest and most considerate staffs we have come across in all our trips throughout europe .
As has been said , some of the rooms may need improvement but if you do n't like the first room you are given it is up to you to request another one .
We also would like to compliment the wait staff at the bar for their friendliness and courtesy .
All these people made our stay in Barcelona much more pleasant .
Never judge a book by it 's cover .
My friend and I stayed at the Majestic in August 2006 for 2 days .
I had been to Barcelona previouusly and thought the Majestic looked beautiul from the outside and liked the location so I booked it by myself through the hotel .
I found the front desk extremely unhelpful in offering any assistance upon our early arrival .
I also asked them to please make a dinner reservation for us that evening and they neglected to call until late in the day at which point it was totally booked .
However , they lied and said the restaurant was closed for the month of August .
I sensed the lie and I called the restaurant from my room and found that the restaurant was open but fully booked .
I also was very disappointed in my room .
I would never go back to this hotel again .
H . Seltzer ( NYC )
Not bad , but not great either .
Not bad , but not great either .
The hotel is right on top of a underground stop , which makes it easy to get to / from , but otherwise the location is nothing special : on a busy road and with nothing much immediately nearby .
The rooms are clean and modern , and the facilities ok - the pool , though small , is pleasant ; the bar lacks character and atmosphere and the breakfast does n't really rise above standard Eurofare , though if you just need some fuel for the day ahead it 'll do .
Our major gripe is the room we were initially checked into : it was like a cell .
There was no natural light at all , the only ' window ' was a small opaque whitewashed panel , which opened onto a vertical shaft of concreted walls .
Though it was on the 2nd floor ( room 202 - avoid it ) it might as well have been in the basement , even in the middle of the afternoon it was as dark as night in there .
It was also tiny , with just enough room to get round the bed .
We walked straight in and out again , and were moved onto the seventh floor and an altogether nicer room : with a window , natural light and good views over the city .
Plus around twice the floorspace .
Outrageous that the hotel could try to pass these two rooms off as being of comparable value .
One is well worth staying in , the other I would n't spend a moment in there even if you paid me .
Really lovely Hotel . . .
shame about the weather ! ! !
What a lovely Hotel , stayed for 4 nights ( 2nd - 5th April 2007 ) and really enjoyed our stay .
The Pulitzer is in a great location for exploring Barcelona with Metro stations close by .
We had a standard room which was exactly as seen on the web - site , maybe a little small for some people but we found it to be fine .
Bathroom and bed - linen were very clean , comfy beds , great maid service .
The only negative aspect to our stay was the weather . . . .
it rained nearly every day but was lovely in England ! ! ! !
Would recommend the Pulitzer Hotel to any - one going to Barcelona , go on book it now !
They need to fire the staff and start over .
The hotel itself is very nice .
Stylish decor .
A great location .
But the staff ruined my stay for me .
We had planned to stay one night at Hotel Jazz and then travel down to Sitges .
But upon waking up on the day that we were supposed to check out , we decided we wanted to spend two more nights in Barcelona .
I called the front desk and asked if we could stay for two more nights .
The woman told us no problem .
After a day of sightseeing we arrived back at the hotel to find that our card key to our room did not work .
We inquired at the front desk .
Apparently the computer had checked us out .
While one clerk checked on the matter , another walked over to inform us that if we wanted to stay the night , we would have to pay a higher rate ( 40 euro higher ) and that it was impossible for us to stay the next night .
We informed him that we had cancelled our reservation in Sitges after being told that we could stay two more nights .
After much back and forth , this very unpleasant man agreed to call the woman that we had spoken to that morning to confirm that we had been told that we could stay two more nights .
He picked up the phone , spoke to someone is Spanish , then turned to the other clerk and said OK . No apology . Just attitude .
Okay if you like late 1990 's minimalism style design .
My review of the Pulitzer is probably biased by the fact that I spent the 3 nights before my stay there at the Hotel Colon , which has in my opinion the best location in central Barcelona .
Yes , the Pulitzer is a triumph of design , but the location , on one of the dull streets off Catalunya is seedy at best , and the hotel lets itself down in a number of aspects .
First point to note is that if you have vertigo , or just a pretty severe fear of heights , then this is NOT the hotel for you .
The glass lifts had me quaking in my boots , and the waist high glass railings which look out over the ground floor bar on each floor were enough to make me feel ill .
I also wondered at the sense of the waist high railings - very little to prevent the intoxicated leaping over .
The rooftop terrace is nice , again once you do n't have a fear of heights , however the bar never seemed to be open although the hotel literature said that it opened from 8pm .
The rooms are fashionable and comfortable , although the overall black and white aesthetic gives a rather clinical lasting impression .
The bathroom was also a good size , with plenty of toiletries , but the sink and shower really lets the hotel down .
The sink , of a freestanding marble square style WOULD NOT DRAIN !
If for example , you washed your teeth , the sink would fill up and then take twenty minutes to drain .
This problem must have existed before our stay , so I 'm very surprised that the hotel placed anyone in the room .
The showerhead also could not be removed , which reminded me of public swimming baths .
But , for those for whom alcohol is key , the bar on the ground floor is lovely ( though smoking ) , and the strawberry daiquiris will take some beating .
Loved the 1898 .
Stayed at the 1898 for a week for our wedding anniversary and loved it .
We had a ' superior ' room in the red and white colour scheme ( 331 ) which was immaculately clean and had plenty of room .
Nice touches included the robes and slippers and the fact they always replaced the soap - maybe petty but I 've stayed in some ' 5 star ' places that expect you to use one tiny piece of soap for your whole stay .
Plus toothbrush and shaving kits as standard in bathrooms - no having to ask reception if you 'd forgotten something .
The location is ideal for exploring Barcelona - I do n't know how someone can describe the location as ' awful ' - umm if you do n't want to stay on La Rambla - then do n't , but it 's on a major tourist central road - I 'm not sure what they expected .
The room was lovely and quiet considering where it was located .
We did n't eat in the hotel as it did seem a little expensive for what was on offer and there are plenty of cafes nearby - there 's a Starbucks next door for those craving a caffeine fix and a number of small supermercados nearby for picking up water / drinks for cheaper than the mini bar .
I will definitely stay at the 1898 for our next Barcelona trip - in fact I ca n't wait .
Find another hotel , this is at best a three star hotel with 5 star price .
I ordered a superior room for three nights in late May 2005 , at the Majestic , assuming this hotel really was a 5 star hotel .
Arriving at this hotel from another 5 star hotel near by we expected at least the same service , quality and professional staff .
But NOT .
After complaining we got a upgrade to a premier room ( 712 ) , not nearby 5 star hotel quality at several hotels I have visited before .
The facts : Price : We paid about 400 Euro for a small , stinky room , with a small bathroom .
Poor quality furniture , but it had a good view from the balcony .
A lot of traffic noise from 0530 in the morning .
We had to have the window open since the smell from the air condition system was really terrible .
Since the hotel was prepaid they even refused to let us get anything back if we moved from the hotel after check - in , even if we complained promtly .
We asked for a refound for at least 1 night , but the refused even this .
Faced with a bill at about 1200 Euro for three nights , we felt like we had to stay there .
So ; If you are looking for a 5 star hotel experience , this is not the place .
The only 5 star about it is the price .
So my message is clear : Stay away from the Majestic , this is a rip - off with their Majestic fantasy prices , arrogant staff and stinky rooms .
We came from the Casa fuster 5 star hotel 500 m away ( a real 5 star hotel ) .
This hotel was compared with the Majestic absolutely fantastic .
Cheaper , better and the service and friendlyness of the staff was superb .
T . Ellefsen , Norway
Great views but stuffy staff .
This hotel is not a 5 star hotel ! The prices are but the rooms and amenities are not .
Some people may not split hairs but I would rate this a good 4 star hotel .
Its not refined enough for a 5 star hotel in my own humble opinion .
Check in was great and easy and the rooms were modern and bright with plenty of wood , sliding doors and mirrors .
LCD TV but no music at all unless you pay for it .
The whirlpool bath worked though not grand enough to be a feature .
The mini bar was well stocked but the prices ! ! do n't go there .
Carefull in the bar , the prices are not cheap , perhaps to be expected in a 5 star hotel .
Three single malts in the bar cost me 66 Euros !
more that the price of the bottle , yes I expect a large mark up in any hotel but come on .
The views were great but you are are bang smack in the middle of a working and busy port , I imagine its noisy in the summer with windows open but when we were there it was a gentle hum in the background .
Quite pleasant I thought and would not stop me going again .
The staff walk about in dark suits and ear pieces , you think you have just walked into a security guard conference or an american presidential stop over .
They are very formal , too formal in fact , someone ought to teach them how to smile and relax and be natural when dealing with their customers rather than impersonate someone with a serious case of piles .
Breakfasts were great , they could n't be faulted but in all honesty a 5 minute walk up La Ramblas takes you to the most amazing food market with about 3 superb tapas bars , their breakfasts whilst not as elegant will be fresher , tastier and a more authentic taste of Barcelona that anything a five star hotel could offer .
But then I suppose most people staying in this hotel would probably find a 5 minute walk too much of an inconvenience to get breakfast .
Room service was really quite good , polite and fast with a great selection .
Checkout was a nightmare , there was internet access on the bill we did n't use , and before they would allow us to settle up the bill they had a member of staff check our departed room for a tapas book from the bar that we had borrowed the previous evening .
Rather than take it back we left it in the room , not a big deal but I think they thought we were going to steal it , but they would n't say as much .
Of course it was in the room but I 'm well presented with good clothes a good watch and the right age to not be viewed with suspicion by staff at check out time .
Would I stay there again ?
No probably not , not really because of any of the bad points mentioned , there were enough good to balance them all out , but in my mind I 've stayed in far better places and life is to short to revisit a place in which your senses were not set alight .
Great Place to Stay AAAAA + + + + + We had an EXCELLENT stay here Nov . 20 - 25 , 2005 .
All the good reviews you 'll read below are true .
This is a real gem , especially for the price and location .
Rooms are modern , clean , large and comfortable .
The staff is friendly and helpful .
The pool area ( although too cold for us to use while we were there ) is much nicer than in the photos .
I would stay here again in a heartbeat !
Disappointment .
What a disappointment ! ! !
The lobby and the staff were good , but the rooms were BIG BIG disappointment - small , Motel 6 furnishings for 5 star hotel prices .
Some rooms did not have a window .
The pillows and towels were 1/2 sized .
To get to the toilet , my broad shouldered husband had to turn sideways .
The only good feature of the hotel was its location - across the street from Gaudi 's Casa Bastilo and 2 blocks from Casa Meri and in the middle of the nice shopping area .
The location was a good walk from Las Ramblas , which is chancy for the late night , unless you are in a group and with someone who knows their way around and speaks Catalon Spanish .
Next time - somewhere else .
If you want a good nights sleep do not stay here .
This is not a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star .
The staff are brilliant but the building though reasonably new is starting to fall appart through neglect .
Check - in was fine as were all the staff encountered but the room was below 3 star as to maintenance .
All facilities were there LCD tv , mini - bar , power shower , whirlpool bath the list goes on .
But the maintenance of these was none existant .
Cheap laminate flooring was starting to lift leaving sharp edges to catch your feet on , the shower door failed to close as it was coming away from the wall so massive amounts of water covered the bathroom ( remember it is a power shower ) .
The Patio doors on the minute balcony refused to close or lock .
The noise from the cruise liner outside our room until the early hours precluded any sleep , not that that was possible as the mattress and the pillow appeared to be made of some stone substitute . Even with the pillow menu a restful night was impossible .
The general air of the hotel , as with the World Trade Centre complex is a little unloved which concidering its age is surprising .
I could not in fairness not recommend the hotel , I may just have been unlucky , but for the money any other hotel in Barcelona would be better value .
The possition of the hotel is great , near the city but not too near , easy level walks to all sites .
Tourist bus stop outside the door and the ever attentive staff are all plus points .
But oh the bed and the noise !
And the appearant lack of any maintenance in room 751 .
Not recommended to people with a back , good hearing or thoughs who wish to wash beyond that it is a very nice , expencive and convenient hotel in which to stay .
We had booked three nights but checked out after the first . .
Do n't Do it - Not worth it .
Hotel has problems : Some uncleanliness , elevator problems , staff not helpful , but most of all not safe to leave hotel .
There is only one entrance to enter hotel so makes it diffifult to enter or leave .
Reason for this is theives and streetwalkers outside .
No police to be seen at all outside .
Had a sales conference here and had 6 thefts on street or room Professional thieves throughout the city .
Be afraid or do n't come .
Not quite as good . . .
As an enthusiastic user of members ' recommendations , we were expecting great things of the Jazz Hotel .
Sadly , it did not live up to the earlier rave reviews .
It 's a good hotel with lovely modern rooms , including a well designed bathroom .
The hotel is ideally situated in the centre of the City , close to the Metro ( which you can hear on the lower floors but it does n't disturb your sleep ) .
What let it down from a 5 star review was :
1 . The fridge did n't work and it could n't be fixed
2. The hot water system broke down on our final night so we could n't shower before we left .
The receptionist made no reference or an apology when we checked out .
3 . The barman ( in the very small but attractive bar ) kept disappearing for over 10 minutes .
This led to some other guests to help themselves !
4 . Some receptionists were very helpful but others could n't be bothered .
Overall , I 'd still recommend the hotel but , based on our 3 day stay , I 'd say it does n't deserve to be in the top 3 .
half a hotel , double a bill .
The communal areas are fantastic , well designed and funky .
The pool area is great , and the general staff very friendly .
The rooms are awful . . . they are large , but are now terribly dated and in need of serious refurbishment . .
the bathrooms especially are horrible .
The cost of staying here ! ! the room rate is high , but my 5 day bill was average of 200eur a day in extras ( room service breakfast , lunch by the pool - grilled lobster 150eur if you are crazy enough to order it , I wasnt - and a drink or two by the bar ) stay somewhere else in barcelona . . . and go to the Arts to visit the great bar and the fantastic Arola restaurant
Not really 5 star .
Stayed at this hotel for a short break with my 15 year old daughter .
Our first meal at the poolside restaurant was very poor quality and mine I returned , whilst the meal we experienced at the Enoteca Restarant left both of us with upset stomachs .
The room service was useless , an inability to co - ordinate the coffee facilities so that cups , saucers , milk and teaspoon were all available at the same time prevailed for our entire stay .
It took two days and several visits from a rather sweaty and smelly engineer ( with very dirty shoes ) to get the shower working properly .
The in - room toiletries had already been used by a previous guest .
The lifts broke ( luckily we were only on the 5th floor ) .
One day the room was not made up until just before bedtime and on another day it was not made up at all .
The final ineptitude was the staff managing to lose our suitcases between the reception area and the taxi area as we were leaving which resulted in our having to rummage around the hotel baggage store .
We did speak with the hotel duty manager on our final night and he was kind enough to reimburse us the cost of the Enoteca dinner , give us a further small discount and offer us the use of our room until 4pm on the day of our departure .
However the shambles continued even after that conversation and we left after what should have been a relaxing stay at a luxury hotel , rather stressed and relieved to be leaving .
It was not a five star experience and certainly not one that I could recommend to others .
the hotel do n't allow parent with two children .
I just arrived today 7 / 25 / 07 the place look nice but I have been around the world and I never have seen unprofessional director like Jose Maria barren that he said that he was the director but I think that he does n't has any education .
I make a reservation with five star alliance two junior suite for my brother and my family
when I get to the hotel after 14 hour of airplane trip I went to the from desk to do the check in and the from desk Alexis Barcel told me that the hotel does n't allow parent with two child , I though I can believe it I came with my wife , my daughter one years and my son 6 years , I never have his problems in any other hotel .
I have been hotel Danieli in Venice , hotel crillon and Athena in Paris , mandarin Oriental London , Bermudas , NY , Chicago , Praga and much more and I never have no problem
then there was a person Jose Maria barran that get into the conversation without any presentation very unprofessional and I told him that his hotel does n't has good service and he told screaming me he out from my house , go to hell and my only answer to him was if he was the owner of that place he does n't treat a customer like that .
thank god I just came to majestic hotel and I got a reservation very nice , more beautiful better attention and care of the customer .
Good but not 4 star .
I have just returned form the Hotel Royal after a trip with my mum .
I stayed here 3 years ago with my husband and son and was dissapointed that our room was not over looking the Ramblas , as it was last time .
The room was small , overlooking a wall , it was v dark and you could only see what the weather was doing outside by opening the window and literally sticking your head out ! !
There were no tea / coffee making facilities in the room which should really be standard in a 4 Star hotel .
The shower was not very powerful , however the bathroom was spotless as was the bedroom .
The room was nice and quiet at night for sleeping .
Staff were very pleasant .
The best thing about the hotel is the location .
We didnt use the resaturant for breakfast - we used the cafe across the street ( Moko ) which was € 2.80 for coffee and toast , lovely sitting outside eating breakfast watching all the traders getting set up the day .
Hotel is also brilliantly placed to get the airport bus , it stops at Placa Catalyuna ( beside El Cortes Ingles ) , it only costs € 4.10 one way and was v quick - 20 minutes and goes every 20 minutes .
All in all its a good hotel but definately not a 4 Star by UK / USA standards , however if its only a clean , safe , quiet hotel in a great location then its ideal .
Good Hotel . . .
Great position / view We went to this hotel during December with my daughter aged 9 for her birthday .
We booked a junior suite , which consisted of a bedroom , a separate living area , a little patio and a shower / hydro sauna combination with a jacuzzi in the bathroom .
The most annoying factor was that when I 'd booked this online , I had made a request for an extra bed for a child in the comments section , I even phoned up SRS to make sure that this was possible for the room type we 'd booked as you could n't specify a child occuping a room with parents on line .
When we arrived at the hotel however , they claimed that they had not been informed and had no record of such a request .
What appeared to be manager of the day made a bit of huff and puff about putting in an extra bed ( rollaway style ) .
This was a little annoying , particularly as it was my little daughters birthday present .
I also thought it bad form that they charge full adult rate for an extra ( rollaway ) bed being put in ( about $ 50 per night if my memory serves me correctly ) , particularly in a suite where you have a separate ' living area ' anyway .
Though reading through the fine print once you 've booked , they do say children over 3 are charged at the full rate .
Eventually it was sorted it out however , and the room was nice enough , though I thought a little dark , as it was on the side of the hotel . .
it did have a little balcony which was nice .
The decor was a little brown / white and minimilist for my liking .
I would have liked tea / coffee making facilities in the room as well , but we did order snack / drinks via room service and it was fine .
The general staff were pleasant and helpful .
The hydrosauna is fun , however , the instructions are not great . .
it took us a little time to work out how to get a steam room effect in it . . and you have to wait quite a while for it to get going ( we though it was n't working ) . . .
The hydromassage takes some working out as well . . we all got hydromassaged heads . . because we could n't work out how to stop the ' top ' jets ( suitable for very tall people I think ! ) .
They do need to put some new plastic instructions into the shower as the ones inside are worn away in parts .
The view from the hotel is just fanstastic . . . .
Barcelona bustling and all the mime artists in the middle boulevard , and you are SO in the middle of it all .
A short walk to the cathedral , which at Xmas was nice with the market .
The metro stop is close at hand as well , handy for visiting all the spots .
Overall , a good hotel , reasonable rooms , great position .
Beware the Majestic !
Preview your room if you must stay !
Ok , so after reading all the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor , my wife and I booked into this hotel .
I am sorry to say we were deeply disappointed .
Room 822 .
I write this , so as to give other potential clients of the hotel fair warning .
Firstly the Good : Location is fantastic , on the Passeig de Gracia an easy walk to the Rambla and a block from the Metro station .
The reception and entrance is grand ; flowers , marble , efficient staff .
The porter service , very sharp and friendly .
The Bad : I think this may all have been the unfortunate ( intentional or not ) allocation of a terrible room . -
The room was tiny , even by European standards ( We have traveled a lot ) .
The small table and chair infringed on the cupboard , so if one wanted to access the cupboard , you had to move the furniture . -
The bathroom was even smaller , my wife and I could not be in this room together .
The toilet is right next to the bath / shower , so getting out the shower was a challenge , and some dexterity was required to stand in the available space .
Also mildew abounded in the shower - The bed creaked and squeaked .
This was partially corrected by housekeeping . -
Our room on the 8th floor was underneath the top floor restaurant , so every night at midnight the sound of dragging furniture woke us up .
Calling the reception to complain got a quizzical response and the promise to send someone up to investigate - I never received a response to this . -
The air - conditioning system is archaic .
Every time the thermostat kicked in , the air turned on loudly , and when cool , turned off , loudly again , keeping up awake . -
Upon checkout , they were very efficient at billing us , but not once were we asked about our stay .
I did complete a survey , and wonder if anyone will see this ?
So in general , it was a disaster .
This is certainly NOT a 5 star hotel .
The glossy exterior belies what is inside .
At 225 Euros per night , it is certainly not cheap either and I am sure better value can be found elsewhere .
Suggestion : If you insist on staying , view your room beforehand ! !
Please do not waste your money on this hotel !
Please , whatever you do , spend your money elsewhere .
I was supposed to stay at this hotel for FOUR NIGHTS ( April 4 - 8 , 2004 ) .
However , due to the coldness / unaccommodating nature of the front desk staff , as well as a room that was in bad need of a paint job ( Room 523 ) , and after TWO UNFORTUNATE NIGHTS , I finally got smart and decided to CHECKOUT .
The room was superbly located ( 5th floor , balcony view of Paseo de la Gracia ) , but the room was horrible .
Absolutely , UNACCEPTABLE in its ' presence .
The only good thing about the hotel ?
Fifteen Euros , flat fee cost for internet use / business center , for entire length of stay .
I was so happy to leave , and go to the wonderful rooms , and spirit of the people at HOTEL AXEL ! !
Half the cost , and by U . S . A . standards , a truly WONDERFUL HOTEL .
Great Hotel .
My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Pulitzer in December 2006 .
It is in a fabulous location just off Placa de Catalunya therefore very convenient for the subway , tourist buses and the shops .
The hotel has very modern decor in black and white , which is reflected through the foyer , bar area and dining room .
The bedroom was very chic with comfortable bed and the bathroom was sumptious .
All the towels were soft and white , all the accessories were included , in case you even forgot a toothbrush .
I was well impressed with all that !
We had breakfast in the hotel and was well impressed with the variety of food on offer .
I 'm not sure how much the breakfast was , as ours was included in a very good rate we had .
I 'm sure it would be worth it though , whatever it is .
My only problem was we were on the first floor overlooking the main entrance of the hotel ; deliveries started at 5 . 30AM to the hotel and neighbouring shops so sleep was hard to come by once I was awake .
The staff were wonderful , friendly , polite , helpful but also a little cross that I did n't ask for a quieter room when I remarked about the noise when we checked out . .
So if you stay here and you are a light sleeper ask for a back room !
All in all though a great place to stay .
Service hiccups and very noisy !
I stayed at the Hotel 1898 March 26 - 31 and was disappointed .
In fact , I 'm writing this at 2am the night before a long trans - Atlantic flight back to the States because I ca n't sleep !
It sounds like there 's a club in my room . . .
it 's so loud that I can sing along with the music when my head is n't about to explode from the club beat .
Apparently , there 's a nearby club that literally rocks the house on the weekends .
BTW , they 're currently playing Flashdance so the club has questionable music taste .
The hotel itself is reasonably nice but the service does n't match the decor .
Other reviewers have noted the location but , believe me , there are lots of hotels in the same location to choose from - it does n't have to be this one .
My primary purpose of being in Barcelona was business and , as such , my key complaints are those of a business traveler looking for service and efficiency . . .
definitely not what I found :
( 1 ) I was n't offered a map of the city when I checked in
( 2 ) I had problems with temperature control in my room .
I spent a couple of warm days in the room before calling the front desk to look at the AC , which they said was turned off . . . . why , they could n't say .
It certainly was n't obvious the AC was turned off because it 's tucked into a side of the closet that requires a sleuthing operation to find .
( 3 ) The hair dryer is one of the worst I 've ever seen . . .
It feels like no exagerration to say it weighs a ton and you have to hold down the button continually to keep the dryer on .
I had dents in my thumbs after I finished drying my hair .
( 4 ) In general , I had a lot of problems with noise . . . .
there was a lot of hammering away in different parts of the hotel during the day and housekeeping was always really loud .
I had to call the front desk twice about noise just so I could sleep away some jet lag for 1 hour in the late afternoon .
( 5 ) It 's impossible to get a taxi at the hotel .
This is a real issuefor people staying at the hotel for business reasons .
I was late toa conference 2 days in a row because it took so long to get a taxi .
The hotel apparently has no special relationships with taxi companies .
( 6 ) I had to call the front desk to get information on accessing the Internet .
I do n't understand why this would n't be explained at check - check-in or on a sheet / placard in the room .
I spent 5 - 10 minutes searching for this information in the room before I finally gave up and called the front desk .
( 7 ) The hotel gym is missing one of the set of two weights that I use in my workouts .
The weight was missing all week so it did n't seem like anyone was in a hurry to replace it .
This may seem like a minor issue , but it added up to a general inattention to the detail that creates a good hotel experience .
Great location .
Just had short stay at the Royal , it is located in ideal location for visiting central Barcelona being located at the top end of La Ramblas .
Our room was comfortable and quiet and located at the back of the hotel .
The staff were very friendly and helpful , particularly looking after our bags after official check out , and directing us to several place that we had chosen from the guide book .
Thoroughly recomend and will definitely return .
stylish but no substance .
The Pulitzer is well located and stylish - as it should be for the price .
Unfortunately , the rooms are on the small side .
More importantly , the service we experienced was very patchy - - not good enough at these prices .
For just a few examples : The rooms were on two nights not cleaned until afer 5pm even though we had left the room before nine .
Asking the staff at front desk to arrange to Fedex a package was a big production , they had little idea what to do .
Even worse , a film crew took over the whole lobby and bar area on our last day , and the staff we completely occupied with the chaos .
They asked us to wait a few hours to check out , and in the meantime the lobby was unusable to guests .
Very disappointing for paying guests .
In summary , if style is all you need , great - - but there are better options that are just as cool .
We would not stay here again .
Hotel Jazz has it all .
Hotel Jazz had it all - great location , decor , price , comforts .
It 's in a great central neighborhood in walking distance to all kinds of restaurants , museums , shops and the subway station is less than a block away .
Beautiful and comfortable inside , expecially the bathroom . Sleek and sophiticated .
This place gave us the perfect rest from busy Barcelona .
Definitely worth the affordable price .
Does n't Deserve It 's Five - Star Rating .
I am not someone who usually complains , but the Hotel Majestic managed to defeat even my stoic British spirit .
Upon arrival , we were ignored as we repeatedly tried to get the receptionist 's attention .
When we were finally shown to our room on the seventh floor , it was dark , dingy , and slightly dirty in parts .
The small window was directly opposite another room 's window , which was a mere two metres away , and allowed minimal light through as our view was blocked by walls , drain pipes and gutters .
The walls were extremely thin , meaning we could hear every noise the rather passionate couple next door to us were making .
The toiletries brought my partner out in a rash , and the bathrobes were so coarse they aggravated my eczema .
Our shower kept switching between scalding hot and freezing cold , and the lavatory kept blocking .
We had requested a double room , but were met with two ( fairly lumpy ) single beds .
We were told to merely ' push the beds together ' , and deal with it .
Had I not paid over 200 a night , I probably would n't have minded so much , but as it was , it did n't seem appropriate 5 - Star behaviour .
The final icing on the - frankly , rather rotten - cake was that the pool and sun terrace were closed .
With such a major part of the hotel out of service , one would expect there to be some notification on the website , and to be reminded of this at check in .
However , I have scoured the website and found no such notification , and was certainly not notified of it at reception .
Instead , guests are informed of the pool 's closure via a small , slightly dog - eared sign in the elevators .
My advice to any potential guests of the hotel majestic is this - DO N'T LET YOUR HOLIDAY BE RUINED - FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ! !
Take A Pass .
Stayed there for five days on business / pleasure .
Location is excellent , hotel is clean , but that 's about all the place has going for it . - -
Service was indifferent , lots ot attitude from the older staff who seem to have lost interest in doing their jobs - - Electronic room keys , recently installed , did not work at all .
Came back once to find the room of my door open ! ( Fortunately nothing stolen ) .
Several times I had to return to the desk to have them re - keyed . - -
Caught the bartender swapping wines on me , pouring a cheaper wine than the one we had ordered .
He claimed it was an honest mistake but the reason I was watching him was because he had been doing it all week . - -
A car service that was supposed to pick me up at the airport never arrived .
The hotel charged me for it anyway , because my flight was late .
Apparently car services are unable to get the relevant information from the airports . - -
Construction was going on right next to my room - - awoke every morning around 8 to the sound of hammers and electric saws .
Requested a room change and was told the hotel was full .
It 's a straight up , intentional rip - off , not just poor service , so I wo n't be back .
Much Better Hotels exist in Same Price Range with Better Service in BCN .
I have stayed at this hotel a total of 3 times and this last stay was the worst .
For a 5 star hotel , they sure dont act like one .
Their reception staff is rude and unaccomodating , particularly to Americans I have noticed over my 3 trips there .
The Junior Suite was small for the price ( 349 Euros ) .
And beware of the packages you purchase .
I purchased a Majestic SUite Package and only received the free bottle of Champagne . . . hotel promised champagne , chocolate truffles and some type of gift on arrival day and I only got the champagne because I called reception .
reception also did not answer the internal telephone so i resorted to calling an outside line and of course they pick up right away - - they obviosuly do n't consider their existing guests a high enough priority !
All in all , I would avoid this hotel .
I plan to stay at a better hotel next time in Barcelona .
I think Majestic doesnt deserve more than 4 stars , and that is being too generous !
Loved the bath ! !
Just back from a 4 night stay in the Grand Marina and like most people have already said was of a good quality .
Unfortunately we never had the luck of some people who got upgraded to a suite but none - the - less the superior room was of a decent size and finish with nice complimentary toiletries to boot ! !
One negative was the fact that they had turned the air - con off throughout the hotel due to the fact that it was winter - however with the temperature still peaking at 23 degrees during the day it did tend to get a bit stuffy in the room at times though a nice breeze could be got by going out to the balcony ( though no such promised picturesque view ) .
We also had the misfortune of losing our baggage but the concierge proved most helpful in tracking it down and dropping it into the room on it 's arrival .
After a long days sightseeing the massage bath is just the job to ease all those aches and pains .
There was a lack of english speaking TV stations but I guess you do n't go there to watch the telly .
The room cleanliness was second to none with our room getting tidied TWICE a day !
Overall a very pleasant stay .
Not a 5* .
View 2 of window
Consistently terrible service - not worth the cost .
I would n't normally write reviews , however after having such a stay at the weekend I feel compelled to recommend to others not to waste their money and stay at this hotel .
Having stayed in a fair few Ritz Carlton 's and other 5* hotels around the world and in Spain , I must say the standard of service was a complete let down .
Many events happened during our stay ( no room available , lost bag , no cleaning of room , lost drinks ) , most staff were incompetant and blamed the hotel being busy , to be honest I did n't want an excuse each time there was problem but a route to solve it .
At the end of the stay we were offered a free breakfast for our inconvenience , which they forgot to apply , another example of overslack behaviour .
Definately would not stay in this hotel again , very suprised with the usual high standards of ritz carlton 's that the resort was ran so badly .
My nightmare at the Eurostars .
In my opinion this hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in .
The hotel itself was Ok but the carpets in the walkways were filthy , the reception was draughty and unwelcoming , the staff were rude and arrogant .
We ordered room service with English tea with milk and grilled slamon , the tea arrived with no milk and the salmon was raw and cold . ( I was told this was normal in Spain )
On the second day I realised that I had a pot of Estee Lauder foundation missing from my dressing table , I reported this and nothing was done , it took a further 2 emails and two phone calls before I had a reply to say that I should have kept all items in the safe .
I was shocked as the safe was only small , would you expect to keep coats and makeup in the safe .
This has never happened to me before . ,
all they offered was a free upgrade to a better room next time we stayed but they would have to pay me to get me to stay there again .
I am not the complaining type but this really shocked me .
Better deals around the corner .
I booked our hotel through Expedia for only 2 nights , just in case I did n't like the hotel .
I 'm glad that I did , too .
I suggest that anyone thinking of staying here go around the corner ( 2 min walk ) to Hotel Inglaterra .
Here 's why:
1. Our hotel room was freezing cold , colder inside than out , it seemed .
I called the front desk to make sure I was operating the A/C correctly and was instructed over the phone what settings to put it on .
The room was still freezing the next day , so someone came up and told me that I had actually turned the thing off .
I do n't think either was correct because I tried every possible setting , the temp was as high as I could set it , and our room was cold the entire time .
2 . The wireless internet is expensive , 15 euro per day per computer .
I paid for the internet and yet I could n't get a signal .
The front desk did rectify this problem by sending me up some big clunky antenna .
It worked , but still annoying .
When using a laptop , the less wires the better , right ?
3 . The hotel room was very mediocre . It was not 4 stars and definitely not worth the price .
The room was boring . I 'm not super into decor or anything , but it was basically furnished like a Motel 6 or something . It was clean , but very basic .
The television was old and did n't work properly .
This hotel is not terrible , but it 's just OK .
I highly recommend going around the corner to Hotel Inglaterra , where I stayed for the rest of my trip .
Overated Hotel .
The Hotel Arts has wonderful installations and superb rooms .
The concierge was consistently helpful .
The rest of the service however was truly dismal .
We waited 1h30 to be served a salad at Bites , the waitress was resentful at our asking the reason for the delay .
The quality of food procured from room service was poor .
After having reported plumbing problems daily for 4 consecutive days , no attempt had been made to resolve the matter ; the receptionists did not appear concerned that no attention had been paid to our requests .
In general this hotel seems to live on its past reputation , one that no longer deserves .
Arts Lovely Hotel But Service Disappointing .
Spent last weekend at the Arts Hotel for a special occasion .
For a deluxe 5 star hotel , I was disappointed at the service .
When I arrived , the conceirge took my travel case for me which would be delivered to my room after check - in .
However , an hour later and a telephone call to the conceirge desk , my case arrived .
I just wanted to throw on a bikini and grab my suntan lotion !
For the both days I was there , I had to call housekeeping to come and clean my room .
On the first day , after spending a busy day , I just wanted to jump in the shower .
When I returned back to the room , all the towels had been left on a pile on the floor and the room remained untouched .
Needless to say , a maid did come to the room after I had been told that they were busy doing turndown for the evening .
I just wanted some fresh towels nevermind about turndown ! ! .
That evening we asked the conceirge to make a dinner reservation for that evening and also one for the Sunday evening as it was a special occasion .
On the Sunday , we did n't have a clue where we were going so asked the conceirge desk , which restaurant we had been booked into only to find to our dismay , that nothing had been booked .
The lady on the desk then started to ring some restaurants only to find them booked ( no surprises at such short notice ) .
By the third restaurant she had called , it was then discovered that a reservation had indeed been made for us but the lady who handled our request the previous evening had failed to tell anyone about it .
On returning back to our room after the fiasco with the restaurant reservation , the room had not been cleaned again .
Once I can let it go but for a second time , I was annoyed as hell only to be asked that was I sure that I left the light on the door for the room to be cleaned .
For those who have n't stayed at Arts before , they do have a simple system .
By inside of the door , there are two switches - one to clean the room , one for privacy .
Not rocket science but when I complained to the check - out desk that all was not well with our stay , I was told that the switches can be confusing ! !
Our room was on the 6th floor which you could hear a lot of traffic noise - probably not a problem if your room was higher up .
That being said , the rooms are fab , the spa is good with great views from the 43rd floor but expensive .
The service round the swimming pool is good .
Remember to take ID if you go to the casino next doorIts a real shame that we had the problems that we did otherwise probably could n't fault the hotel but for the money we paid and the reputation of this hotel , it was rather disappointing .
Hotel Royal disappointment .
My Husband and I booked a three night stay in Apr 07 at the 4 star ( ? )
Hotel Royal on Las Ramlas .
It worked out cheapest to book directly with the hotel via the website however we feel , after staying , that the hotel is over - priced and over - rated .
In our opinionit should only just scrape a 3 star rating .
The hotel is bland and unwelcoming although the reception and housekeeping staff were friendly .
There are absolutely no facilities within the hotel so you really are just paying for a room .
The tv was old and could only pickup one English speaking channel - CNN .
We appreciate that you do n't go away on a city break to watch tv but it 's nice to have the option as it is a facility advertised and one which you are paying for afterall .
If you like to iron your clothes before an evening out , take a travel iron as the hotel does not have one you can use .
Also take a travel kettle as the rooms do not have tea / coffee making facilities .
The adjoining ' restaurant ' was expensive and the menu limited and unimaginative , especially for vegans / vegetarians .
The pizzas look better than they taste and the complimementary olives tasted stale .
The salad consisted of a handful of mixed leaves and half a tomato !
Overall , we would not recommend this hotel and will not be returning to Barcelona .
Apart from some nice architecture , the city is dirty , overcrowded and really you could be in any other city in Europe . . . plenty of Starbucks , Mc Donald 's and Burger King 's if that 's your thing .
We were particularly upset to see caged birds of all varietiesfor sale along Las Ramblas and the pet shops were also archaic selling puppies on show in glass fronted cages .
If you are still tempted to visit , stay in a hotel off the Las Ramblas as I think you will get a much better deal .
Transport around the city is good so getting about is easy .
Use the Aerobus to and from the airport - cheaper and less hassle that the Metro .
Shady Hotel .
There were problems from the start .
Upon arrival we were forced to upgrade or leave the hotel due to lack of rooms .
A day later , the hotel 's water supply cut off until 12 pm , this happened several times .
The toilet had to be fixed about twice which is really annoying .
There is black mold in the bathrooms and around the airconditioning .
The pool is tiny and covered in black mold .
The only positive thing this hotel can offer is space .
The manager at the time was just bad , first initial J .
Terrible ! ! !
From the moment I check in to the time I left there were a number of problems in the hotel and the service from the staff was extremely poor .
Since I booked a club room I had access to the club lounge where I checked in and there I was told I had a no show the previous night although I had a booking confirmation showing the correct dates .
The staff promised I would n't be charged but of course they did and after several telephone calls they refunded my credit card .
The club lounge was the only good thing about the hotel , located at floor 33 , where delicous food five was served times a day along with french champagne and a large variety of wines .
Later the same day the water stopped running in my room and after a long discussion with the staff I got a new room but not at the club level which meant constant problem to get to the club lounge even though the staff promised the new key should work to get to floor 33 .
On my last day I was going to see football and the tickets were delivered to the hotel 3 days before my arrival but the concierge found them a few hours before the game started after having searched for them for 2 days ! !
Do I need to say that I do n't recommend anyone to stay at Arts Hotel Barcelona ?
Good and Comfortable hotel .
We decided to spend Christmas and New Year in Barcelona and decided on the Hotel Gran Marina - less than a 10 minute walk from the old port to the Ramblas .
I planned it was quieter than being right amongst the action in the town or Ramblas .
I got a good deal over the holiday period - surprisingly better than all the online hotel finders , by going directly to the hotel itself .
We did book it in July but it was a good lesson in that all the cheapest deals offers are not always the cheapest .
Closer to the holiday I ordered some flowers for the room as a present for my wife and even though the hotel already had my credit card details as part of the booking process , they wanted payment up front and I had to mail photocopies of my passport and credit card .
I was unhappy at this risky exercise and it certainly was not what I expected from a 5 star hotel .
I also wanted to reserve a table for New Year 's Eve and this also was subject to the send payment up front process .
We arrived to a friendly welcome and a very comfortable King Premier room , which I had requested at the front of the hotel so that there was a view of the city and waterfront .
The rear of the hotel faces into a large inner square , bounded by office buildings and does not have any views .
Breakfast was good at a fixed 15 euros for a help yourself comprehensive buffet but if you only wanted a coffee and a croissant , it was still 15 euros .
We ate most breakfasts by having a short walk to the Ramblas and trying the different bars and restaurants there .
The hotel is on a large arm that projects into the port area and it is a very busy ferry terminal as well as cruise ships port - presumably many cruises in the summer .
This did cause some continuous noise during the evening and early morning .
There was also a disco in the base of one of the nearby buildings which was noisy as people exited in the early hours at weekends ( and summer ? ) .
Both of these noise problems would probably be solved by an inner room but sacrificing the views - you pays your money and takes your choice .
Room was very comfortable , complementary cava and chocolate strawberries on arrival ( absolutely recommended ) and there were fresh sheets put on the enormous bed every day by a very efficient maid service .
A relaxing and very friendly bar lounge and a roof top area that would be great in summer - just a little cool in the December sunshine .
The door staff also worked hard and responded to quips and jokes .
Reception and Concierge were overall friendly but not very efficient .
We tried to book for Christmas Lunch and were told that there was n't a table available , then there was , then one concierge team did not pass on our booking for 2 days to reserve a table .
When Christmas lunch came , a very well prepared 4 course meal , there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant occupied - you do n't expect to be given this sort of run around in a 5 star hotel !
Concierge had advised us that there were some areas in the city that needed to be avoided and that very late at night we should phone Reception , who would send a taxi for us .
We went to Christmas Eve midnight mass in the old Cathedral and on exiting after 1am we phoned for a taxi .
The response was very busy , not many taxis , you 'll have to walk , I ca n't help you ! ! !
I would be dismayed if a 3 star hotel staff member told me he could n't help me but when a 5 star hotel Reception member tells you that , then I question their commitment to guest service .
We walked home and did arrive safely but it was the low point of the stay .
Because we were staying for a 3 week period the hotel requested me to settle an interim bill half way through , something that puzzled me as I had given them my credit card detils back in July ( and had posted them with my passport details ) .
Anyway I paid it but found on my return home that they had debited the amount twice on the same day and even though they refunded it a few days later , it had sent my bank account into the red and I had to pay bank charges on it - so much for 5 star efficiency !
Overall - yes we enjoyed the stay despite the hotel 's failings and I think this was made up for by the atmosphere in Barcelona .
It was buzzing in December , so goodness knows what its like in the height of summer .
We had read about the iffy areas and the scam merchants but our impression was that the city takes it 's tourism seriously , there were always police about ( not in an unnerving way ) and the streets were always clean ( we saw street sweepers cleaning up at 1 - 30am on Christmas morning ! )
They are making big efforts to further clean up the old areas and overall we felt safe and relaxed , even on the metro - which is a fabulous system , as indeed is all the transport set up .
Just be aware it is a big tourist city and keep your wits about you - do n't flaunt money or cameras , etc . .
The Barcelona people are a strange breed .
We came across waiters who were unfriendly to the point of hostility but if you just accept this as some city quirk and let it go over your head , then its quite fun to be really friendly to someone who is having a permanently bad day , every day .
The friendliest waiters and bar staff are the ones from out of town !
One tip - check your change , as many waiters and taxi drivers decide what tip you are giving before you have thought about it and take it upfront ! !
Barcelona - yes , loved it - the difficulties just made the experience more interesting ! ! !
Fabulous hotel !
Highly recommended ! ! !
My husband and I stayed at the Jazz Hotel for 2 nights Sept . 9 - 11 , 2005 .
We could n't have been more pleased . . . . this hotel is wonderful !
The location is perfect - so close to La Rambla and steps away from Placa Catalunya , which makes getting to and from the airport ( by Aerobus or by train ) very easy .
We loved the ultra modern decor in the bedroom and bathroom .
The rooftop terrace has a pool which is quite small but has a nice view .
We loved this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona .
Problems with Website .
I have not stayed at the hotel , but did make an online reservation through the hotel 's official website .
This has proven impossible to cancel online .
The hotels cancellation web - page is non - responsive and my hotel - issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box .
I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer 's comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e - mailed his cancellation .
Obviously this hotel has problems .
Not Majestic At All ( Awful Hotel ) .
My experience with this hotel was terrible ; I 've booked and paid a superior room and they assigned me a classic room which is extremely smaller than superior room and when I spoke to the front desk personnel he replied to me with a silly answer that superior rooms has some bigger rooms and other rooms are smaller !
How deceive someone can be !
Relating to their treatment ; the Hotel front desk was rude , inhospitable and unfriendly .
Finally , I do n't recommend anyone to stay at the Majestic Hotel because of its overpriced rate and do n't be deceived by the luxurious looks of the lobby because their rooms are really awful .
simply disappointed .
I 'm simply disappointed .
maybe Majestic 's management does n't know what a Five Stars Grand Luxe means .
this hotel should be a 4 stars , and I 'm generous .
I paid too much for the poor room I got ( a superior , not a standard ) , che bathroom is a joke , small and not clean as it should be ( some NOVOTEL 2 stars are more comfortable ) .
breakfast is nothing special and everything is very expensive .
swimming pool is not avaliable , and we were n't informed when we booked .
5 stars GL is the maximum rate for hotels .
this one surely does n't deserve it .
NOT RECCOMENDED .
Good Hotel , but Not Exceptional Value .
We stayed for four days at this hotel last week ( the week after Easter ) .
I would say the hotel is perfectly adequate for a 4 star hotel , with reasonably - sized rooms and adequate service , but perhaps not quite the top notch status as some other reviews might suggest .
Although we have no real complaints about the hotel ( it justifies its 4 - stars ) , we are not convinced of the premium it seems to command . ( It would , for example , have been cheaper for us to stay at the Claris , the Sofia Gran or the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar - all 5 star hotels ) .
What you 're paying for , I guess , is its very central location at the heart of town , and close to attractions / amenities such as the ramblas , the gothic quarter and near to transport links .
It also has a panoramic roof terrace , with good seating and an outdoor pool ( which was surprisingly warm at this time of year ) , as well as a small ( and stone cold ) indoor pool and spa .
However , there is only one restaurant , and one bar ( based round the lobby ) and one cafe ( not counting the resident Starbucks ) .
The restaurant is competitively priced ( at least in hotel terms ) , but was surprisingly devoid of guest , as it is very easy to eat out ( which we did on a couple of nights ) .
The breakfast buffet has a diverse range , and is good value if included in your booking .
Overall , this is a competent and well - located hotel , particularly if you can get a competitive rate ( which was hard for us , even three months out ) .
However , for the price of 230 euros / 拢160 , it 's not quite in the same league as ( for example ) the Plaza in New York , Claridges in London , or the Shangri La 's in Asia . ( It 's more akin to the Malmaison boutique chain in the UK - but perhaps costing slightly more , with fewer extra touches . )
Having said this , though , our stay was pleasant and comfortable , and our only complaint ( if that 's the right word ) , is that they sting you 16 euros to advertise one of their flaky umbrellas when it rains . ( Guests staying in the hotel opposite were treated to complimentary Meridien golf umbrellas . )
As for Barcelona , if this is rated as one of the best hotels , then all the other 4 ( and 5 ) star hotels in the city must be considerably wanting .
We observed that , although we speak three different languages , it definitely helps to speak Spanish ( and specifically the local Catalonian dialect ) , else you tend to be treated as a second - class citizen with all but the most service - conscious locals ( who are few and far between , from our experience ) .
Petty theft in the area also seems surprisingly common - we even met a well - travelled couple who got their handbag / purse stolen by thieves who threw pidgeon poo at them ( and used it as a distraction for robbing them ) .
loved it .
Location is great . .
and my room size was good . .
Staff were nice and we enjoyed our stay . .
probably a bit expensive i think . .
Average hotel at great location .
We chose this hotel on the basis of the location and the reviews in TripAdvisor .
The location is excellent .
In the middle of everything , very close to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya .
Spot on .
Otherwise there was nothing special in this hotel .
The hotel was art deco style - we have nothing against it , but there was nothing special in the interior that would have warmed our hearts .
The room was OK , but again nothing that would make me long for this hotel .
The bed was average and OK , but with these room prices I would have assumed a higher level of quality . Still OK .
What was not at all OK was the soundproofing of the rooms .
The exerior walls and the windows let all the street noise in - including louder conversations of passer - bys .
Also the in house noise of the bar ( clings and clangs of the glasses ) three levels down continued late and was clearly audible inside the room .
Fortunately we were so exhausted of walking the lovely streets of Barcelona that we fell instantly asleep .
But if you have any trouble with your sleep think what I just wrote above .
Breakfast was OK .
The staff was OK as well , but again there was nothing that would make me say they were particularly friendly .
Summa summarum : excellent location - bad soundproofing - everything else average .
Overbooking notice 1 day before arrival .
Ok so I never actually stayed at the hotel , but if this is how their service operates then they deserve the 1 star rating - as does Opodo who I booked through .
Booked the hotel for two nights over a month and half a go - money taken , and all booked up according to Opodo .
18 hours before depature and Opodo call to say the Hotel is overbooked and that they ca n't get us a room , and the Hotel is offering hotels of much less quality to stay in instead .
Awful .
Great location . . . but disappointed .
We booked this hotel through our cruise line and felt comfortable that our 6 star cruise line would choose a very fine hotel for our stay .
First the positive : the breakfast was excellent ( one of the nicest we have ever had in Europe ) and the location was very close to the information center , Ramblas , the tourist bus , and the Gaudi sites .
We felt very safe walking in this area , even at night .
We were to receive a prestige room and were expecting a room like the one pictured on the website .
Instead , it was merely a classic room ( the base room ) with a balcony .
The room and bathroom , while tastefully done , were quite small .
Other cruisers , who stayed at various four star properties in Barcelona , and visited our room , said our room was not as nice as theirs and they paid considerably less .
While the room was n't miniscule , we paid for more , according to the picture , and expected more .
Additionally , there was no concierge available and when we made restaurant reservations each night with the front desk , each night the reservations were wrong .
The first night , the gentleman at the desk rang the restaurant we were told no reservations were needed and to go directly to the restaurant .
THere was a long line and we had to wait for 40 minutes .
The next night , even though we wrote out what we needed , the time of the reservation was wrong and we found out that they made the reservation an hour earlier than we requested .
There was no confirmation as we are used to in a hotel of this class .
Even room service was lacking , for two days they never emptied our waste paper basket .
Lastly , porterage was supposed to be included in our package , yet our porter , who was very nice , told us he was not informed of this and wanted his tip .
It was very embarrassing .
We have stayed at a number of four and five star hotels and were disappointed at the poor service levels and value for our money .
It is certainly not what one expects of a hotel of this calibre .
not so grand marina !
my self my wife and our two friends recently enjoyed a short break in barcelona but unfortunately the hotel did not quite live up to the high expectations we had believed to experience in the grand marina .
niose levels from the disco below had our friends moved on 3 occasions and ourselves once .
prices at the hotel are in keeping with the hotels name exceptionally - grand 5*************
Great hotel .
Here with work function for 2 days . . . excellent place , however , appointments ( ie : fittings ) in the rooms are the only thing that hold me back from giving a 5 rating - the appointments are a bit old fashioned - early 90s than recently fitted high - end hotels .
But that 's a real picky issue .
IT 'S A LOVELY HOTEL !
Great location for work event .
Food is good .
Beautiful lobby areas and great service .
PS : I have no idea how much my company is paying for this
Do not stay here .
My husband and I stayed at a few hotels in Barcelona in May 2005 , and we were extremely disappointed with the Royal Hotel .
It is listed as a four - star hotel , and this is absolutely not the case .
The room we got was VERY small ( I would estimate 10 x 10 feet maximum ) and the hotel looks like it has n't been renovated in years .
There was no view from our room ( we looked onto a white wall that was about 5 feet away from our window ) , the room was musty and dark and the decor is very old and dank .
The hotel is well - located in the heart of La Rambla , but this did not compensate for the poor upkeep and style of the hotel .
The hotel lobby and reception desk are fine ( although the photos make them look nicer than they actually are ) , but once you head up to your room , it is all downhill .
I would strongly recommend finding another hotel in Barcelona because there are many with better value and better cleanliness .
I would not even recommend this hotel to budget travellers or students , since it is relatively expensive .
The only people that should stay here are people who only care about location and really want to be in the center of the city - you can walk almost anywhere from this hotel .
Having said that , there are plenty of hotels in the neighborhood that may have nicer amenities at the same cost .
Pick a better spot .
We stayed 2 nights at this average hotel that is priced above average .
The room was pretty nice but there was nothing in the hotel beyond that - the lobby is very small with only facilities being a couple beverage despensers .
The elevators were small .
We didnt eat there as it was expensive .
The staff was ok .
It is just not anything special for 140 E excluding tax and no breakfast .
Confirmation said internet facilities yet there were none .
Great little hotel .
We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights following a short cruise which ended in barcelona .
The hotel was easy to find , maybe 5 mins walk from the top end of the Ramblas .
The hotel is very modern and fairly minimalistic in decor .
The staff were English speaking and friendly .
Although we arrived at 9 . 30 am , they had a room for us by 10 am .
The room was spacious , good king size bed and blackout curtains .
There is a great ( small ) pool on the roof terrace with views around barcelona and it was empty on the first day .
By the second day the pool area was busy , but there were still seats / loungers .
We got a late checkout no problem .
We didnt try the room service / bar , but the maid service was accomodating with the time the room was made up .
I would highly recommend this hotel .
Despite being a 3* , it has all we typically find in a 4* .
Location ! Location ! Location !
We stayed here in July 04 , and wow , you simply can not ask for a better - placed Hotel , bang where it 's happening ! ( on the infamous Ramblas ) .
Bars / Restaurants a plenty , all within a stone 's throw .
We found the Hotel to be clean and tidy , with efficient , cooperative and friendly staff .
The general quality of the rooms / hotel exceeded our expectations by far , given the rate we paid .
The bedrooms are adequate in size , with AC , good size / quality , clean Bathroom / WC , and a nice large walk in wardrobe with room safe , and Colour Sat TV .
Tho some rooms do n't necessarily have a view , so ask for one at the front of the building ( but this will be noisier if you leave the windows open ) .
Breakfast buffet is good ; help yourself as much as you want .
The Reception staff were SO accommodating , and helped us out as we 'd ( a party of 8 guys on a stag ) inadvertently booked Doubles rather than Twins , so on arrival we asked if they could change our booking , they said they were fully booked and that it would be very difficult to do this , however , they pulled out all the stops for us and within the hour had changed our rooms so that we all had beds to ourselves !
I would thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel , and would undoubtedly stay again when visiting Barca .
Not going to mention much about the Ramblas that has n't been said before , except to say , yup , believe the hype !
It 's a great place for young , old , single and couples , however put on your streetwise hat , because there are hustlers working the Ramblas and you could easily fall prey to pickpockets , ' street magic ' hustlers and also , ( late at night ) the ladies of the night , so BEWARE ! !
Nice Enough - Make Sure You Use The SAFE !
Nice enough hotel , clean and fairly well located .
The only problem was that my partner had her necklace stollen from our room , they claimed that it was our fault because we had not put it in the safe provided !
We even put the do not disturb sign on the door and they still went into the room to clean .
Apparently they have to go into every room at least once a day as previously somebody died i a room and went un - noticed for 3 days .
Breakfast was a dissapointment and would NOT recommend paying the 拢15 for it .
The swimming pool on the roof is nice enough although very small ( a lot smaller than it appears from the photos ) and can get very busy as the roof terrace is quite small .
Overall not a bad hotel , smart , clean and helpful staff , if you do stay here be sure to lock everything in the safe !
They also have security deposit boxes which are in reception , these require 2 keys , one for you and the hotel keep the other and these are big enough for a laptop - I would recommend using them and not leaving anything lying around .
Oh and there is free Wi Fi connection which is good .
would not stay there again .
This hotel has a fantastic location being near Las Ramblas but for a new modern hotel , it is extremely noisy .
The rooms are very nice but with hardwood floors , you can hear people walking in the rooms above .
The walls must be paper thin , because you can hear people in other rooms talking and we were right beside the elevator and it never stopped - right through the night , that elevator kept going .
We put out the do not disturb sign on our door in order to have a well deserved nap in the afternoon but that did not stop the cleaners , while vacuming the hallway , of hitting our door and the walls 4 - 5 times while cleaning ( this happened on both days we were at the hotel ) .
Also , on the morning we left , the hotel staff would not order us a taxi for the airport until after we had checked out .
This delayed us by 15 min and it was not appreciated .
The worst and most unaccommodating staff ! !
The Hotel Jazz has the worst customer service I 've ever encountered !
After reading the good reviews on this website ( I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews ) , I booked a room at this hotel .
I walked into the hotel and attempted to maneuver my heavy luggage down a flight of stairs in the hotel lobby towards the reception desk .
Despite the fact that they were not busy helping other guests ( the lobby was empty ) , none of the three men behind the desk made any attempt to help me ( an obviously small girl with very big luggage ) .
Then , sleeping was a problem because there was a consistent rumble and vibration that came every 10 minutes ( I suspect it was the metro ) .
On my last morning , I woke up late because the rumbling noise kept me up most of the night .
I called reception to ask for a late check - out of 20 minutes . . . yes , only TWENTY minutes and was told NO !
They claimed they had a lot of people checking in and needed the room right away .
It 's ridiculous that they could not spare the room for 20 minutes , especially for a guest who could not sleep because of noise resulting from the location of the hotel .
I looked out in the hall and despite the fact that it was already 11:55 a. m. , the maids were not yet on my floor and no one had knocked on my door that morning , so I know they had not yet reached my room .
There was no way the maids were going to reach my room within the next 25 minutes .
The staff simply did not want to be accommodating .
I quickly threw all my stuff into my luggage and as I was walking out the door at 12:10 ( keep in mind that check - out is at noon ) , the phone ran .
It was front desk asking whether I was going to check out or whether I wanted to pay for the additional night .
It was absolutely ridiculous and the worst customer service ever .
One of the main aspects of a comfortable stay is that the staff cares about you and tenders to your needs .
This was completely lacking at the Hotel Jazz .
They got me in the door , got my $ 200 / night , and that 's all they cared about .
I plan to be in Barcelona again soon , but that was my last time at the Hotel Jazz .
Do n't make the same mistake as me - - heed the warnings contained in the bad reviews on this website .
A Good stay at the majestic .
our corner room
Fantastic ! !
This hotel is superb !
It 's in an ideal location if you do n't mind walking and taking in the sights .
It 's ideal if you do n't want to be taling taxis everywhere .
We tended to walk down the Ramblas early morning and stay out until 3ish and then go back to the hotel to relax by the roof - top pool .
Towels are provided which is bonus if your just on a city break - extra packing room !
You can even ring down to the bar for drinks whilst you sun - bathe .
The rooms are of an excellent quality , contempory design with good air conditioning .
We arrived at 10am in the morning and were allowed to check in .
Over - all if I went back I would definatley stay here again and have recommended it to many friends .
Kirsten Scott , Staffs UK .
As advertised .
I decided to stay at this hotel as it was my first stop after 30 hours of travelling from Australia , and I wanted a comfortable room .
I stayed on the fifth floor , facing the main street and I barely heard any noise at all - not even any subway noise as mentioned in other reviews .
As I was pretty much shattered after my flights , and suffering from a cold , I spent a great deal more time in the room than I had intended .
I found the room to be very comfortable and the in room wifi was very handy .
Overall a great stay .
Do not stay here .
Well I was greatly disappointed after reading rave reviews on this site .
Firstly the staff are appalling , unfriendly and any request from you as a guest is treated with disdain .
It took me one hour to get some food up to the terrace for my elderly mother , breakfast was a joke - so badly organised that we ended up laying our own table one morning .
It is also incredibly noisy .
This place has been put up quickly with untrained staff to make money .
I read , just before leaving , that someone had their luggage stolen in reception area and this does n't surprise me as they could n't care less .
I chose this hotel because I was travelling with my mother and seven year old and thought that after a day 's sightseeing it would be a nice place to sit by .
It is dusty , the umbrellas do n't work and the view could be Calcutta .
I looked longing over at the Hotel Angleterre 's beautiful terrace across the street .
The pool , be the way , is 4 metres by 3m and 1 metre deep so whoever stayed there and enjoyed doing laps must be vertically challenge !
Sorry but it left me feeling ripped off and angry .
You need to stay in the Gotica area away from La Ramblas .
Super and Sullen .
The arrival in a taxi from the station was a non event .
Struggling with our suitcases the doorman did not make any attempt to help us and one of us is seriously disabled .
In fact nobody made any attempt to help us .
Made us feel a but queasy about this place .
right from the start . . .
Not particularly welcoming staff at the desk .
All very strange for a 4 star " hip " hotel .
Room was superbly smallish and narrow ish , however , except for some minor ( major to us as it was a room especially for " disabled " ? people ) details it really was good accomodation .
BUT . . although the shower was excellent it was so dark you could n't see the soap !
NO facial tissues available at all . . . . and most importantly the only socket in the bathroom is very far away from the sink for shavers , toothbrushes etc . . . .
And imagine no socket for the laptop on the fold down desk ! . . .
I had to ask for an extension cord to be able to use a socket clear across the room .
The bed , though , was exceptionally comfortable as were the choice of pillows .
Most annoying of all was the sullen staff everywhere ( one exception : the excellent bartender ) and most especially the unpleasant staff in the restaurant .
Even when our wallet was stolen the front desk could n't have cared less and helped even less than that .
Checking out from hotel was incompetent as the cashier tried the old / new trick of trying to charge in our local currency instead of Euro . . . . and then when he had to reverse the transaction he managed to block that amount off our credit line for 9 days after !
A struggle as we had lost our principal credit cards and were living on a debit card off of an obscure account of ours !
I would never return to the Pulitzer only because of the staff . . . .
the hotel is perhaps passable for just the atmosphere of the place itself and the rooms but the staff . . . . phooey !
Great Hotel .
Just returned from a five night stay in Barcelona .
The Hotel Jazz is a good hotel - the hotel , rooms and bathrooms are very clean .
The room was a reasonable size with LCD TV and minibar .
The bathroom was clean and well stocked with toiletries - hairdryer is located in bathroom and not in main room .
Hotel staff were friendly on arrival but did not speak unless we approached them .
Do not recommend that you buy drinks in the hotel bar or from the mini bar - very expensive .
Did not eat in the hotel so can not comment .
Would recommend breakfast / drinks at the bar opposite ( d ' Or ) as reasonably priced and very friendly staff .
Would recommend a visit to the hotel roof - pool looked inviting and plenty of sun loungers .
Unfortunately weather in November did not allow us to sit and relax by the pool .
Hotel is close to Placya Catalunya - but more than the 100 meters from La Rambla stated on Expedia .
Would definitely recommend you see the following : Sagrada Familia , Casa Batillo , La Pedera and Pablo Espanlo .
Entry to all discounted if you buy a Barcelona Turistica bus ticket .
Give yourself plenty of time to see each as you will be suprised by the amount of time spent in each .
Bring comfy walking shoes !
Good buy is Don Simon Sangria from the Champion Supermarket on La Rambla ( Euro 1.79 per bottle ) .
Market just off La Rambla is best place for snacks .
Utter luxury ! ! ! ! !
Stayed for a couple of nights in April and i have to admit this is probably the most comfortable hotel i have ever stayed in .
If you can , go for the Club Class rooms , truly amazing size with the the best bathroom / shower room i have experienced .
Club class gives you access to your own lounge with food drink etc - Very comfortable .
Great service and food for the late night snack i had in the 1st floor restaurant .
Also excellent service from the bar staff who served us drinks in the garden area beside the swimming pool .
Its the Arts every time for me ! ! !
So so experience .
Wheels on small beds
Great Location .
We stayed three nights in January .
The room was somewhat small ; however , we had a choice in the category of a suite or a room facing the Passeig de Gracia , and we opted for the view .
We made the right choice , as the room had french doors to a small patio with a tremendous view .
Everything else about the room was good - clean , nice bathroom , etc .
We were only there a few nights , and who spends a lot of time in the room ?
Our reservation did not include breakfast , but there are plenty of options close by .
There is a coffee / pastry house just across the street .
The location was terrific - close to public transportation , shops , restaurants , etc .
Service in the hotel was good , with easily - available advise which was appreciated .
Good dinner options around .
I would recommend Costa Gallega , one block north on the Passeig de Gracia ( get the piquillo peppers stuffed with crabmeat , patatas bravas , and wash down with a good cold glass of the local Penedes wine - Vina Sol .
Very reasonable .
Oh yes , I forgot , the beds were about the most comfortable we ever slept in .
I would definitely recommend this hotel .
Great Location .
This is a stylish modern contemporary hotel in a great location .
The rooms are spacious , comfortable and great value .
The bathrooms are tasteful and luxurious .
The roof top pool was great ( if a little cold in May ! )
The bar is trendy and we had great service .
I did n't make it up for breakfast either day ( this was down the to the great night life ) so can not comment on the food .
All in all our 2 night stay at the Jazz Hotel was fab and if I was ever to return to Barcelona I would def book the Hotel Jazz !
Hope this helpsxx
What a find !
We returned from Barcelona last weekend - it was our first visit and a special occasion , celebrating my husbands birthday .
It was a surprise booking for him and the hotel was discreet in all correspondence since my booking earlier this year .
I booked a superior room and it exceeded all expectations .
We had views around the city , our bedroom opposite the Cathedral .
The hotel is situated on La Ramblas , but you would never know as our room on the 6th floor was well sound proofed and tucked back with views of the luxurious suite privatepool terrace below .
It was an oasis amidst an exciting and lively city .
The hotel was exceptionally clean , the facilities including the roof terrace and spa were superb , the room finished to a high standard and the service was very friendly at all times and nothing seemed to be too much .
We will certainly return as we managed to have a long weekend with a good mix of rest , sun evening relation on the roof terrace , cool drinks by the pool , sight seeing and excellent food , wine .
The only point we would make is book your own taxi to the airport from outside the hotel , the taxi company charged us nearly double the fare when we booked through the hotel to return to the airport .
We Expected Better .
July 8 , 2007 - Brooklyn New York the Majestic is centrally located and makes a good home base to explore Barcelona but for over 300 Euros a night we expected more .
Our room was on the first floor overlooking a the street and was quite noisy at night particularly when a couple of ambulances sped by .
Also we were expecting a Queen size bed but our bed was two separately made twin beds put together - not what we expected for a romantic getaway .
the room was clean and of average size - nothing out of the ordinary .
Breakfast was good but the breakfast room was subterranean with no windows and a tad claustrophobic plus the coffee was weak compared to other European hotels .
The elevators were n't working well and it turned out to be a blessing that we were on the first floor when we had to walk up and down the stairs .
Not 5 star quality went . on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of .
Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation , the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel , which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare .
We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we did n't get much satisfaction .
I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service .
We will not be going back there .
Modern , Well - Run Hotel .
This hotel is conveniently situated within short walking distance of the Barcelona Sants railway station offering direct service from the BCN Airport .
The hotel is a modern high - rise , with large contemporary rooms , efficient , helpful staff ; and the included breakfast in a beautiful 23rd floor setting was among the best we have experienced in extensive European travels .
Highly recommended for reasonable cost lodging in an expensive , beautiful city .
Great hotel in central Barcelona .
Have just returned from a great 3 night stay at this hotel .
We had a tripple room with 2 twins and a great sofa bed .
The room was quite large and very clean .
The staff were very helpfull and the breakfast which was included at a great rate was good .
The location is great .
All in all a great hotel - would definately stay again .
Niggles at the Jazz .
Just rerurned from a 3 day break from Barcelona staying at the hotel Jazz .
Having stayed in Barcelona on 3 previous occasions , I can safely say this is my least favourite hotel .
Whilst the rooms were clean and reasonably well equipped , there was an unpleasant damp smell in the bathroom and no mirror in the bedroom .
For those who rely on straighterners or tongs , it was a thankless task styling hair in a steamy bathroom !
When the mini bar was restocked it was irratic and on one occassion I had to request clean towels as these had not been replenished by housekeeping .
We were room only and were not impressed that on 2 of the 3 mornings cleaning in the corridors started at 8 . 45 , not the alarm call that we had requested !
In addition , I can not endorse other reviews relating to the staff .
The reception staff were fine but I was rather disappointed that a security guard / concierge ( not sure which ) watched myself and two daughters struggle down reception stairs with heavy cases without offering to help .
The bar , although pleasant , was irritatating as it was never staffed and it was impossible to get a drink after 11 . 30pm !
The one plus re this area was that internet access is free !
I also was disappointed that staff were not more supportive towards a young honeymoon couple whose luggage had been lost and when reunited with its owners was badly creased .
The couple asked for the use of an iron but were told that this was not possible and that there was a charge of 5euros to iron each garment
My main reason for selecting this hotel however was to take advantage of the rooftop pool .
On the first day the weather was 21c and I looked forward to taking a dip .
I was disappointed by the size , barely bigger than my bath , and the concept that the pool is heated was laughable .
All in all a disappointing stay and next time I 'll go back to the Rivoli Ramblas !
Louise , Newcastle upon Tyne
Wonderful Hotel !
After reviewing several 4 - 5* hotels in different areas of Barcelona , I 'm glad I booked the Majestic .
Location - superb for sightseeing , transport links , and shops .
I felt safer staying near the Paseo de Gracia at night than other areas such as Las Ramblas and Bario de Gothico .
Rooftop views stunning .
Classical double room adequate , clean with a comfortable bed .
Would have liked tea / coffee making facilities to have been provided .
Quality breakfast with good choice of food ( if you 're after a full - English breakfast , do n't eat here ) .
Interior decor very tastefully furnished .
Leisure facilities a little disappointing - pool very small - hot - tub would be nice .
If you 're looking for a central hotel with that special something , then I recommend the Majestic .
Do Not Waste Your Money .
I am amazed that this hotel has a four star rating .
It lacks everthing that a four star hotel should have .
The pool is very small and the gymnasium should not be a feature .
The noise of traffic is unbearable as it is located on a busy road .
There is a very small bar in the reception , but there is no bar staff and if you want a drink the porter has to fetch someone from the restaurant upstairs .
The rooms are very small , but clean I have to say .
The most dissapointing thing was the staff .
Every member of staff was rude and unhelpful .
One example , was when we asked for toothpaste which is a little sachet provided at the beginning of the stay .
Our request was refused and there was nowhere local to find toothpaste .
Were were also charged €63 for car parking in possible the tightest car park in the world ! !
Such a bad experience , never again . . .
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone , the staff is unhelpful and rude , the rates are overpriced and the rooms are like a youth hostel .
I was very disappointed at the fact that this hotel was rated and priced like a 4 star hotel when it was in fact really a 2 star hotel .
New Year in Barca !
This trip was a special one as it was Mr Chucklers 40th birthday .
Mrs C had taken care of all the bookings and on that basis I can only assume the hotel made it very easy for her ! ! ! !
Good communication throughout the enquiry / booking process I am reliably informed - I was delighted on arrival as it was a total surprise !
We would recommend a taxi from the airport for a ' no fuss / bother ' way to reach the hotel .
Cost €30 .
Mrs C had organised a bottle of champers and it duly arrived shortly after going to our room .
The hotel is perfectly located 5 minutes walk from Playa Catalunya Las Ramblas .
There was a metro station 100 yards from the hotel door - perfect for exploring the city .
It was great to be so close but yet out of the hustle bustle of Las Ramblas !
Check in was friendly and our room was very modern and clean - a superb range of toiletries were available too .
Mrs C had booked a room on the 6th floor , following other Trip Advisor reviews and in fairness the metro rumble did not bother us at all .
We did not have breakfast in the hotel as there is so much choice close by and at much better prices !
In reality we enjoyed the hotel as a place to sleep and freshen up as Barcelona has so much to offer - one criticism would be that we did not find the beds overly conducive to a good nights sleep .
For us the Harbour area was perfect . . . . beautiful walks and lovely street cafes bars line this spectacular area .
One bonus was that we were able to obtain tickets to see Barca playing , albeit against a 3rd division side in the Copa del Rey .
The ground is easy to get to from the hotel using the metro and is a must see on any trip to the city .
All in all we would thoroughly recommend the Jazz - it lived up to its reviews !
There is a great cafe next door to it and El Raco restaurant is also recommended ( turn right at the front door ) .
Very Dissapointed ! !
Do not stay here !
My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights and were very dissapointed with this hotel .
It is classed as a 4 star hotel and this is definatly not the case , the rooms are very basic , decoration is extremly dated and the rooms smelt damp .
The fixtures and fittings inside the rooms were poorly maintained .
The photos of Hotel Royal are very deceptive .
The restaurant that the hotel recommend La Poma is awful , do not eat here !
Although the hotel is situated in the heart of Las Ramblas , there are plently of very nice hotels situated here too !
For the price of the hotel , I would have expected more .
The rooms are NOT sound - proofed , although they do block out the noice of the street , they do not block out the noice from the rest of the hotel , as we were woken early every morning by other guests .
You can hear everything your neighbours are doing !
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone , nor would I class it as a 4 star hotel !
Lock Up Your Valuables !
Hotel was OK but noisy traffic all night .
Be sure to LOCK UP your stuff ! ! !
I lost a nice pair of earrings tucked down into the bottom of my makeup bag .
The management was not helpful .
Main plus point is it 's location .
Location was great but the rooms although a fair size were too hot and stuffy and you can not control the temperature .
Advertised complimentary tea and coffee was no longer complimentary on arrival .
Breakfast was acceptable .
Not a hotel for people who want to come back and relax with a drink etc
NO SLEEP AT THE JAZZ WHAT A NOISE ! . . . .
Just returned after spending two nights from 21 to 23rd October 04 at the Jazz .
After reading the great reviews for this hotel i was not dissappointed with the good standard of room etc , however , when we went to bed on our first night , WHAT A NOISE !
We first thought it was the sound of the lift going up and down .
The noise seemed to be every 10 mins or so and vibrated the room .
We changed rooms to the second floor , but the extreme noise continued .
The next morning we spoke with the manager and discovered that the noise was from the MET UNDERGROUND TRAINS !
The manager did not offer any apology for our lack of sleep .
We did move rooms again to the seventh floor , but every seven minutes the same noise shook the hotel .
This needs to be mentioned to guests prior to booking this hotel .
I would suggest that you take some ear plugs if you intend staying here !
Good , but a caution . . .
I like the modern decor , and the location is excellent .
The roof - top swimming pool is a priceless option on a hot summer day .
Friendly staff .
Unimpressive breakfast and zero atmosphere in the adjoining lobby area , but so what .
The construction quality is rather shoddy , and the rooms can show obvious signs of damage ( big patch in bathtub , wall lamp partly pulled out ) after just one year of operation .
The first time I stayed there just after the hotel opened , we were on an upper floor and had no problems with noise , though one could hear muffled street sounds in the background .
The second ( and probably last ) time I stayed there , I was on the second ( lowest ) floor , and the metro was hugely bothersome and impossible to ignore .
I could feel the vibrations in the walls ! !
I can confirm , the Barcelona metro stops just after midnight and starts at 5:30 am .
Stay at this hotel .
But get a room above the fourth floor ! !
Fantastic views of the city and great location ! ! ! !
I stayed in the Gran Torre Catalunya hotel for five days in August with my boyfriend and we chose this hotel on the basis of reading other reviews on tripadvisor .
Good Points We had a fantastic time at the hotel , the room was clean , sleek and modern with a ' to die for ' marble bathroom with a bath big enough for two and him and hers matching sinks ! ! !
The bed was huge and comfy and the views from our 10th floor windows were brilliant ! !
We paid for our breakfast as part of our package and the choice was very impressive , fresh meats , cheese , pastries , yogurt , fruit juice and pancakes ( served with a choice of sauces , my favourite was chocolate ! ! ! )
They also served the usual scambled eggs , bacon , baked beans , toast !
The views from the hotel restuarant on the 23rd floor are fantastic and not to be missed , this is the major selling point of the hotel and many of the city 's attractions such as Sagrada Familia , Montjuic and the Olympic Stadium can be viewed from here .
The staff were friendly and helpful , even the maids would say good morning when we passed them in the hall .
The hotel boasts a spa area but we were so busy we did not get the chance to use it !
The other guest were really quite and there were no rowdy groups of people making a racket at night time .
The hotel is a great base for exploring Barcelona , Monjuic is within walking distance and the metro is across the road and so easy to use it makes sense to see the sights using this method of transport .
Bad points Air conditioning !
It is a saviour in some respects but it is a nuisance at night time and made us feel really cold , you can control the temperature but you ca n't turn it off , it also made a bit of noise so if you 're a light sleeper you may fine your sleep disturbed .
Traffic ! The hotel is in a busy area on a busy stretch of road so traffic noise is to be expected ! ! !
Plus the windows are not double glazed so you may find it annoying at night time !
Finally , some of the reviews stated they had robes and slippers in their hotel room , we did not have this so do n't bank on it !
Also some reviews have complained about having two single beds pushed together to make a double .
My advice would be to request a double bed when you check in and also request a room higher than the tenth floor to great great views and reduced traffic noise - with that said I would definately stay at the Gran Torre again and will be recommending it to friends ! ! !
5 Stars ? ! ? !
You 're kidding , right ?
I am currently staying at the Hotel Majestic .
I had my business travel agent book this hotel based largely on the reviews on TripAdvisor .
Upon checking in , I asked about the size of the room , as I had read some reviews complaining that some rooms were quite small . ( Also , as I was checking in , I overheard 2 people trying to change rooms because they were n't happy with their first rooms ) .
I must compliment the front desk clerk who helped me check in .
She was extremely nice , but when I asked her about whether my room had a view or was a nice size , she frowned and said , that yes , indeed , I had been booked in one of the smaller rooms , but a nicer , larger room was available if I was willing to pay more .
Since I have been traveling on business in Europe for more than a week and desperately needed sleep , I decided the extra charge was worth it for a better room , so I took it .
While the room does have an extra sitting area , I have to say that this room is NOT of 5 star quality .
There are marks on the walls , the furniture upholstery is worn , and the overall qualilty is more of a 3 . 5 star hotel , as far as rooms are concerned .
There is also the annoying LOUD sound of water rushing through pipes on the other side of the wall of the room , approximately once an hour .
The lobby area is nice , and the general location of the hotel is quite good , but as a business traveler , I really want the rooms and beds to be nice and comfortable .
This marginally passes those criteria , particularly for the price for this room .
Also , there is no ethernet connection so I am connected to a wireless connection that is not very reliable .
Location ( and some good online reviews ) were the deciding factors in choosing the Majestic .
However , having been here one day already , I am disappointed and wish I had gone with my first inclination to stay at the Hotel Arts .
I would encourage the Hotel Majestic management to update the rooms and also encourage restaurant staff to make foreign visitors feel a bit more welcome .
Excellent rooms and great location .
Great location : easy to get to the city .
Hotel rooms ( standard double bed ) were perfect , huge beds and the usual : TV , bath , bidet ( perfect for cooling cava bottles ) , hairdryer .
We were offered to upgrade but we didnt .
We were on the 3rd floor ( 1st floor of rooms ) , view was n't great but since we were out most of the day didnt matter much .
View from the 23rd floor is amazing , although we did n't eat there ( student budget ) .
We had breakfast in our rooms having bought previously things from the supermarket at the bottom of the Hotel .
We used the SPA facilities , and would definitly recommend them . It was quite quiet ( we went round 6pm ) and they are clean , no real pool so would n't recommend the Hotel for a family with small children if a swimming pool is a necessity .
there is a small heated pool however in the SPA area which is nice to relax in .
Staff was reasonably nice but have to agree with a previous review about the lack of character , slightly cold . . It did seem very buissiness and professional but again being out most of the day , was ok .
We ordered food through room service , although a little dear , the food was very nice and service excellent as well .
To sum it up : excellent hotel recommend it for couples , buissness men / women , for a relaxing weekend . .
Only annoying thing was the noise from the builders outside , but should be soon ended .
Not Impressed . . .
We stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Pulitzer with our two sons .
The rooms are quite small and minimally furnished - - for example , there is n't a stand - alone desk , rather , a fold out work station .
The tv is tiny .
There are no tissues in the bathroom - - you have to call housekeeping to bring you small packets .
And if you want some ice , you have to pay a service charge to have it delivered or go to the bar to get it yourself !
Pretty unbelievable for a supposedly 4 star hotel .
The staff were nice although their English was n't very good .
On the positive side , the hotel is very well located and has free internet service .
Excellent Hotel with Brilliant Views of Barcelona .
We ( my fiance and I ) stayed at Hotel Torre Catalunya for three nights / four days and had a wonderful time from the moment we arrived until the moment we left .
Every aspect of the hotel and service was 1st class and I wouldn not hesitate to stay here again .
Checking in was efficient and straight forward , no problems in this area .
We were apparantly allocated a room on the 5th floor ( I suppose they say this to everyone lol ) and were asked if we would like to upgrade to a higher floor for an extra 10 euros per night .
We were offered a room on the 19th floor , we upgraded .
The views we had over the city were worth every euro !
The room was excellent , spacious , modern and very well kept as was the bathroom .
The bathroom had a huge bath , seperate toilet area , twin marble sink and a brilliant power shower in a large marble enclosure .
Loved the shower !
The bed was kingsize whilst the room had the extra 's you would associate with a 4* hotel .
Mini bar ( very reasonable prices ) , complimentary drinks , in room safe ( six digit coded ) , tv , phone and so on .
No complaints at all with the room or any aspect to do with the hotel .
We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis .
The foods available for breakfast were varied and well presented on the 23rd floor which provide super views over Barcelona .
There is a lounge bar on the ground floor that provides you with the 1st drink of your stay free , a nice touch .
Food is also available , which was of a good quality .
On the lower floor there is a spa area with additional beauty treatments including massages if you desire .
Obviously , these are for an additional fee .
The hotel is a little way of La Rambla and other tourist attractions but believe me this is not a problem when you have a public travel set up as good as Barcelona .
Sants station is right next door , metro stops are plentiful , buses are available , taxi 's are cheap and last but not least the fantastic BUS TOURISTICO !
We paid for a two day ticket that cost 22 euro 's each .
If you want to get around the sights , use the bus touristico it 's great .
If you fancy a stroll , you can be at La Rambla in 30 minutes .
A final point about Barcelona , football lovers get yourself to the Camp Nou and do the stadium and museum tour and if you can get to a match . Fantastic .
Tourists , do not miss the Sagrada Familia ! Exceptional !
Pay your eight or so euros to gain entry and help fund the building of this great Gaudi cathedral .
There is so much to do in this multicultural city , it 's great and we will be back and will have Hotel Torre Catalunya as our base .
Torre Catalunya .
A nice place to stay Plus points .
Nice bedroom , great bathroom and very clean , helpful receptionist who checked us in early and explained the train system etc .
Great view of the city from the restaurant .
Good breakfast .
Tube stations close .
Minus points .
Sants station building works , listening to jack hammers one morning at 2am nice .
Would not recomend stopping here until the works is complete which looks like will take a long time .
Not many nice places to eat in the vicinity .
If you want good food go to the Attic near the top end of the Ramblers .
If you 're looking for a great meal out in a modern , chic setting , this is the place for you .
Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at .
How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me .
I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in .
The staff are very helpful , professional and friendly .
The decor is very tasteful , the location is great , the price is very good value , the mini bar was very reasonably priced , the hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very quiet for such a centrally located hotel .
I would certainly return to and recommend this hotel .
Great place to stay .
We stayed at the Torre Catalunya for three days and had a terrific time .
The hotel was amazing and had everything you could have wished for . It was totally spotless , everyone who worked there was extremely polite and it was in a good location .
The hotel is situated literally a stones throw away from the station and metro that can take you into town and takes about 5 to 10 mins .
We took a tour bus for two of the days and that was great and the stops were right outside the hotel .
It 's great that the station was so close as we didnt have to rush in the morning of our flight , we just walked a few seconds to the station , got on the train and the third stop was the airport and was so quick and easy to get to !
This is a gorgeous hotel to stay in .
You even have a computer suite with internet access , a lovely beauty parlour with swimming pool and beauty room and also an amazing restaurant on the top floor of the hotel with amazing panoramic views across the whole of Barcelona !
Definately 10 out of 10 !
Tighter space than a ducks - - - 5 star hotel i don't think so . . . .
Room was the size of a rabbit hutch and the service at check in was average for a travel lodge !
The whole point of a five star hotel is to feal spoiled but all we felt was ripped off , a bit like all fur and no knickers ! !
Location is too far out compared with the Gothic quarter , the view from the roof top pool was great but unless your can swim in 2 inches of water dont expect to go too deep in the roof top pool
Great hotel but not without it 's ( bad ) surprises .
Having stayed in Barcelona a number of times decided to treat myself to the Grand Marina - brilliant location , brilliant views over the harbour / Mare Magnum and good sized rooms with equally good sized and well equipped bathroom .
All was well until 1 . 30am when a ferry proceeded to moor outside the window of my room and then leave it 's engine running all night ( and through to 17:00 the next day when I left ) .
No amount of double glazing was going to stop the noise but on a 5* hotel I 'd expect at least a warning to be prepared for noise .
Not surprisingly no response to a complaint ( both in person at departure and in writing ) hence time to make others aware so that they book well aware of potential issues .
great deal , great hotel , great location .
Very nice four - star hotel only a few blocks from the popular Las Ramblas road .
Friendly courteous staff , all English speaking .
Room and bathroom were huge by European standards .
Had Sky satellite televsion .
A bit noisy if you have a street - side room , but with the windows closed the noise is well insulated .
Very close to subway stop .
A great choice at any price , but was an especially good value with the rate we got .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .
Disappointing .
A business type hotel close to Sants station , convenient for access to the airport and the metro station for Barcelona 's tourist spots .
The rooms were spacious , clean and well kept .
For breakfast there was a wide choice of food available but the organisation was dreadful and on the Saturday it descended into the farcical with guests queueing for upwards of 30 mins to get into the dining area .
One further point , check your credit card bill carefully , I found 40 + euros were charged to my credit card after we had checked out .
Willing to give a second chance .
We stayed at the Majestic in November 06 , The room was quite small and dark ( overlooking a fire escape ) for the price paid but it was very clean and the staff was very helpful .
We are planning to visit the hotel again in January 08 and have book a superior room which I am hoping is a bigger and brighter room than before .
We said we would give the hotel a second chance as the staff made a lasting impression on both my self and my wife We arrived around 11am and checked in straight away no problem which was great .
The location is great with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance .
Overall we enjoyed your visit which is why we have chose to stay again but would not be impressed if the room size is not greatly improved .
Noisy , expensive , small rooms . .
We arrived at the hotel sunday at 15 . 00 , and our room was not ready .
Ok , fair enough , the hotel asked if we would like them to store our luggage , which we would .
We got back two hours later , and had to wait 25 minutes to check in , because the reception was crowded with guests .
After this we had to wait another 20 minutes to get our luggage up in our room , and we went down THREE times to ask where it was .
We also said that we could bring it up ourselves if they were short of staff .
No respond . .
I think we got the worst room in the whole hotel .
2nd floor ( 1st floor is restaurant ) , tiny room , and our window faced a backyard , which in fact just was a hollow room inside the hotel . ( with a roof . )
Our room was extremely noisy , we could hear other guests all night , and the maids startet at 09 . 00 . .
We did n't eat at the hotel , and it was clean and elegant , and that 's pretty much the positive things that can be said .
Royal Hotel - Las Ramblas .
This hotel has a great location if you want to do the whole tourist thing around the Ramblas .
It 's located right on the Ramblas near the Placa de Catalunya and within easy walking distance of the Born area and such like .
The cost is about what you 'd expect to pay for the location .
I stayed in one of the small double rooms . It was fine as you do n't really go to Barcelona to stay in a hotel room .
The rooms have most of the standard facilities and are clean and comfortable .
I 've stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions on business trips as well and the staff are friendly and helpful .
Awful !
The hotel is supposed to be four star - not in my world it wasn ' t !
The staff were surly on the desk and the rooms were dismal .
The bed had a plastic undersheet that russled every time you moved and made you feel like you were staying in a care home for the elderly .
My room was too hot the air con was n't switched on and on opening the window for air the room stank of frying bacon from the kitchen I suppose .
I complained but was told there was absolutely nothing that could be done .
I got no sleep as the next door room were obviously rekindling their love life and the sound proofing was non existent .
I had the pleasure of visiting the hotel 's restaurant - though restaurant is not what I 'd call it .
The staff were even more repugnant and the pizza I had was unbelievably bad .
This whole experience cost 250 euros for two nights - my advice is do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel it was a revolting experience .
Stolen iPod Nano , but OK besides that .
Biggest problem : our iPod Nano was stolen from our rucksack , most likely by hotel staff .
We checked out at 12pm , and left our bags in their storage , since our flight was not until 10pm .
After sight seeing , we collected our bags and went straight to the airport , in a taxi , with the rucksack at our feet .
After check in , ( we had no check in luggage ) we realised the iPod was missing .
We 've since contacted the hotel , but they say they can not find it , and have no idea .
I remember packing the iPod into the top pocket of the bag , and it had been in the hotel 's care between the time we checked out of the hotel , to the time we were at the airport .
There was no way it was stolen while at the airport as i was carrying the bag infront of me .
Gym : great equipment and range of weights ; better than most hotel gyms .
However , the air con was not on high , so it got really hot .
Plus , they played the same music everyday , and it was very slow and mellow , totally unsuitable for a workout .
Pool : Small .
Lobby
Lobby  Lounge : great tapas , especially the seafood . The best meal of our trip .
Cost about 100 euros for about 7 tapas and wine , and coffee .
Room
Room : great little touch of a choice of pillows to choose from , all named after old hollywood actresses .
5 star , I do n't think so ! !
My Husband I decided to extend our cruise by staying for two nights at the Majestic .
We booked the Majestic because of the fabulous photos on its website , however in hindsight should have checked Tripadvisor reviews first ! ! !
We booked a ' superior ' room as it was our wedding anniversary however were given a really shabby standard room .
I can say that this was possibly the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in ! !
The room was small very dark and really grubby - especially the walls which could do with a good lick of paint and carpets replaced .
Its only redeeming factor was the bathroom which was small but clean .
On arrival the exterior lobby are very impressive , however thats about all this hotel has to offer .
My advice , stay in a nice 3 star hotel , 5 stars this hotel is ' nt .
christmas weekend away .
on la rambles
Service and location perfect .
We stayed at the hotel last december , booked directly .
The location is perfect , walking distance for the shopping and all the key areas of Barcelona , the room was large and quiet , very clean , the staff is lovely and really helpful , breakfast is delicious .
We recommend this hotel for people looking for a good 5 stars hotel in the center of Barcelona .
Very Disappointed .
I was very disappointed by the service of the hotel staff , and the accomodations .
Upon arrival we were not greeted by a staff welcoming us , but rather rebuffed for having 2 bags per person for a party of 4 .
The hotel was not ready to put us in our room , and offered no suggestions for tourists .
This hotel was best suited for locals , not international travelers .
Finally , I left a laptop computer when I check out .
The hotel confirmed they had found it , and would ship to me at my cost .
After a delay of a few days , I contacted them again , and they stated that they thought they had my laptop , but it was something else .
The hotel is conveniently located to some interesting activities and attractions around Plaze de Cantalun . . .
there are also other / better hotel options than this one in the area .
I would not recommend staying at this hotel .
Central and well looked after .
We stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights in Hotel Royal .
It is cituated in La Rambla which is the most touristy area of the city .
Also close to the metro and buses and I would say an ideal location .
We had a room on the fifth floor looking at the back .
No view at all . Just facing a wall .
Not nice but we had booked via Expedia . com and the price was on offer .
The good thing was that it was quiet .
Breakfast was not included in the price .
The room was good and very clean .
Good facilities and well looked after .
The attidude of the staff was neutral . Not very friendly or helpful but not rude .
Overall good experience and probably I would recommend it because of it 's location .
5 Stars Not Enough .
It is hard to do anything but add praise to Hotel Arts Barcelona .
It is the finest hotel we have ever stayed in .
Our 26th floor suite overlooked the Port Olympic Marina , and the Mediterranean Sea .
It wasn ' 't until we checked out that we were even told about our upgrade .
5 Stars were not enough to describe ouir experience .
Service was amazing .
We were there for 7 days , and after the second day , many of the staff knew us by name .
On our second day without luggage thanks to Iberia Airtlines , the young lady in Guest Relations took pity on us , and sent a complementry bottle of Cava to cheer us up , followed up the next night with a selection of tapas .
We only had breakfast at the hotel , which was outstanding .
The rest of the day we were out and about enjoying Barcelona , the most vibrant city we have ever been to .
One block walk takes you to the Metro , and from there , you are minutes away from everything , or you can stroll to Las Ramblas in 30 minutes , mostly along the beach .
There is also a plethera of fine restaurants and clubs of all types and at the hotel doorsteps .
Great location but be prepared for noise !
Just returned from a long weekend at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona and have a pretty mixed review which i hope will be helpful for those thinking of staying there .
The hotel is lovely and clean , the beds and bathrooms are big for a city hotel and staff are friendly and helpful , the rooftop pool is a fab advantage and the views are n't bad .
However the hotel is in no way soundproofed internally !
it is true we could n't hear any street noise but the sound of the person in the room above showering was enough to wake me up every morning as well as the noise of the lift and staff and guests making their way along corridors which echoed throughout the rooms !
Breakfast is a complete waste of time and was worse than anything i have ever tried to eat - definitely worth getting up and going out for it .
Other than that it was a pleasant enough stay but would definitely choose somewhere else next time .
Great location , comfortable room , but . . .
View from the nicer room
Ok to stay here .
I found this hotel pretty average .
Stayed in rm117 and the room itself was ok , but in need of renovation .
The windows are quite sound proof - but noise came mostly from housekeeping staff , not entirely their fault , just the doors did not keep the sound out .
The location is a Big Plus for the hotel as it is in the city centre minute walk from the underground train and just across the square is the airport bus .
I think I will try another hotel in BCN next time - but I would stay here again too if needed .
Amazing Hotel , Great Location .
view from room
Majestic Arrogance .
I travel to Barcelona very regularly , and I chose to stay at the Majestic recently , only down to its location and promised services . . . . . . and also a curiosity from having passed the hotel on several occasions .
I would say that the hotel is very average in every way .
It is an old hotel , hence you can not expect huge functional rooms .
Their website tells you classic rooms are 20 sq metres . . .
they do not hide the fact that their classic rooms are tiny , however , images on their website are not representative of the actual rooms , for instance , the bathroom in the image under classic room is not the bathroom you will receive ; the bathroom will actually be very small and will require the agility of a gymnast to navigate .
When I brought this up , the point was ignored .
Wireless internet was also advertised . . . . . could I get reception ?
Only by holding my laptop in the air at a strange angle , in a strange position !
For a 5 star hotel , the bar is reasonably priced .
The food may perhaps be decent . . . .
they will tell you that Drolma has a Michelin star , however , when hot food is served very cold after a very long wait , it is difficult to ascertain quality ( and no apologies made either ) .
5 star ? Well , yes and no .
In Spain , stars are awarded convincingly on facilities , not quality .
I have not often experienced such average 5 star facilities with tacky unimaginative decor , but they do what they do and they do it well enough to run a " successful " hotel .
Having had a look at the better rooms , I would suggest only staying here if you were prepared to pay the extra for an upgraded room .
I would suggest staying elsewhere rather than a classic room unless you are supremely interested in location and you are not bothered by impolite staff and ineffective service , though the classic rooms are very cheap , so this may sway you .
If you want good service and a good all round experience , stay elsewhere .
I would perhaps make some suggestions to the hotel , however , I have read some of the responses made to other reviewers on this website , and I find these to be rude , unhelpful and argumentative . . . . similar to the attitude when face to face with the front desk staff .
I would rather just move on to a different hotel than waste any more time with this hotel .
Barcelona is a lovely , bustling city , so the Majestic will not really have a problem filling beds , however , some time in the future , they may need to rethink things .
Loved it .
Really clean hotel with nice spacious air conditioned rooms .
Large bathroom .
Although there is nothing in the area near the hotel it is right beside the metro stop and main train station .
We used metro on our stay in Barcelona and found it great to use at nights too .
Really good value for the money
Be very careful .
Good location but doggy hotel as Passport disappeared from our room in the hotel room when the staff cleaned .
Passport magically reappeared a day later after reported to hotel Management , Police Consulate .
Would never return again to this hotel
24 hours missing .
In the past I stayed with my husband in this hotel .
I was very pleased many aspects of the it , such as the rooms , the staff , the decoration and so on .
The big trouble was when I was taking the plain back home and remembered that I had forgotten a sweat - shirt in the hotel bathroom . . .
As soon as I got home I called the hotel . . .
well , the first call of many more that would come . . .
I gave the exact information about the location of the sweat - shirt and even pointed out that was a rather expensive piece of clothing ( more expensive that all my stay at the hotel ) and also with emotional value .
Despite all the calls , the staff was unable ( and not willing ) to solve the problem , I did n't have the opportunity to speak with the manager , and they revelled an arrogant and not concerned attitude towards my issue .
In sum , in less that 24 hours a client 's personal article was lost and no one ever took any responsibilities for it .
This is an intolerable situation in any hotel .
So , I do n't recommend this hotel to anyone , mainly because it does n't inspire me any trust .
In my case , it was a piece of clothing , in any other case , it could be anything much more valuable .
Any person can forget anything in a hotel room , so think about going to this hotel twice .
Because I am totally certain that shirt was in the room .
Three months later , I 'm still waiting for a phone call that never came and never will come .
Mafalda Silva , Portugal .
Fabulous location .
You ca n't beat the location of Hotel Royal , It is central to everything and although it is on the main thoroughfare it is totally soundproofed and comfortable .
Staff are very friendly and helpful
Great hotel in Barcelona .
Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Majestic .
The location of the hotel is wonderful , walkable to everything ( we walked to the port a couple of times and also walked to Parc Guell ) , but not in an area overrun with crowds .
The room ( a Deluxe ) was wonderfully clean and well appointed .
The service , typical of European hotels , was not top - notch , but still serviceable .
Nice bar on the ground floor and a separate Cigar Bar across the hall .
Would definitely stay here again .
Looks nice but has a big problem .
First impressions were great .
Sexy cool lobby and understated but classy looks from the street .
Up to the rooms with the cases and it still looked very nice and cool .
However thats the first for two big problems .
We had two massive cases with us and hand luggage , and the front desk was manned by two staff members and a porter .
No other guests and no offer of any help with the bags .
Amazing in a hotel of this class and price range .
So being typically english we did it ourselves but not a good opening impression .
By the way this was repeated on checkout .
No help whatsoever and 4 members of the lobby team watched us struggle past to the taxi .
The rooms are good , Well furnished with a super cool lighting system and very nice bathroom .
However here comes big problem number 2 .
The rooms are REALLY noisy .
You here everything from the corridor .
Its like the door isnt even on .
So if your looking for sleep or relaxation . Forget it .
This is a party city and we were constantly woken throughout the entire night by drunken guests returning to their rooms .
Not good enough for a Hotel charging these prices .
You expect to sleep surely ?
The rooftop terrace is fantastic !
Very trendy , cool and amazing views .
The pool is very small though , but loads of places to sit / lie and catch the sun .
So this is a Hotel for party people we think .
Cool bar scene , and if your coming in late from clubs , you 'll love it .
However if your looking to relax and get a decent sleep , be careful as we didnt !
It was just okay .
I too read the reviews but was n't sure about the location .
The Ramblas can be rather hectic .
Since we had two stays in Barcelona , decided to stay at the Montecarlo on the way home .
I was impressed with the desk clerk and the breakfast , but my room was very disappointing .
The carpets were stained and the room lacked any ambience .
It was not a luxury room , nor was this hotel cheap .
The room looked like a motel room .
Aside from the fresh orange juice , good coffee and internet access , I would not stay here again .
Fantastic .
Luxury bed
OK . . . but not a great neighborhood .

Central Location .
Not a bad hotel but certainly not worth the 4star rating or 4star prices ! ! ,
the rooms are very clean and functional but are very small .
The staff are friendly and willing to help .
In - room tea and coffee facilities would be a bonus . .
The location of this hotel makes it ideal for exploring all of Barcelona .
Try other hotels , certainly not this one .
This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed for the past 30 years .
This hotel is absolutely not a 4 - star hotel . A 2 - star may be .
Fantastic Hotel , Brilliant staff , let down by NOISE .
On Arriving it was a relief to arrive to some normality from staying in Paris for two nights .
the staff were faultless from start to finish .
the room , which i paid extra to upgrade on arrival , was fantastic , nice dark wood floor , great bathroom , travertine tiles , spa bath , the bedroom was brilliant , pillow menu , kingsize bed and 180degree views of the harbour .
however the view was the let down , 5am a ferry docked up right outside my window , to be honest it would have been everyone on that side 's window as it was so big , cue a very loud PA speaker for 15 mins , followed by men hitting metal on metal for i have no idea what reason .
all in all a great stay completley ruined , if i had any heavy inate objects i would have thrown them at said chaps with hammers or whatever it was they were so carelessly using .
i would have given this hotel a 4 or 5 rating but the noise really did ruin everything .
it 's totally without justification for a hotel of this price and class to sell someone a room knowing that at 5am there will be noise that literally no one could sleep through , earplugs and double - tripple glazing could n't have drowned it out .
that being said , do stay here , but make sure that if you do , as you look at the hotel from the front , only stay on the left hand side looking onto the city rather than the harbour , even then i think that PA will travel .
Not so Majestic .
I stayed at the Majestic for 3 nights .
The advantages were the location and the gorgeous Christmas decorations .
But other than that , we did not enjoy this place too much .
The room was the cheapest one , hence very small . Too small .
Also it was so dimly lit that we had to ask for an additional lamp in order to read .
Overall the room seemed to be rather worn out and old .
They need a makeover sometime soon , at least by 5 star standards .
The people at the front desk are not very friendly . They hardly smile .
The worst thing about this hotel was that they mistakenly double billed me . They were not very apologetic about it either .
I stayed at the Claris hotel as well , which is just one or two blocks away .
If you are trying to decide between the Claris and the Majestic , I would definitely recommend the Claris .
The rooms at the Claris are much more spacious , modern , stylish and clean .
The staff are more casual than the Majestic and some people might not appreciate that , but at least they smile more and are friendlier .
If I had known better , I would have stayed at the Claris the whole time and not have bothered to stay at the Majestic at all .
Great Location .
We stayed here at the beginning of April .
We picked this hotel having read the reviews .
The best part of this hotel is it 's location .
It 's on a side street , turning left out of the hotel it 's less than one minute 's walk from Pl .
Catalunya and turning right it 's less than one minute from a Starbucks cafe .
Room : We were not fortunate enough to get an upgrade as others did , so we had the basic room which is quite small width wise without the couch but with one armchair .
The television is on the wall facing the bed and every time we passed it we felt we were going to hit our heads .
The lighting is very nice and you can dim them if you are in the mood which is a nice touch .
There are robes and slippers provided .
The bathroom is very nice with nice fluffy towels and shower gel , shampoo and moisturiser provided .
There is also a man and woman box which has a toothbrush , toothpaste , razor , etc . but one thing missing is cotton buds which is usually provided in 4* hotels .
We booked the romance package which included breakfast and a bottle of cava .
For anyone else booking this package , apparently the cava is delivered to the room around 7pm in ice bucket with two champagne glasses .
We had to ask when it would be delivered .
If we had n't and only returned to our room late after eating , I would imagine the cava would have been warm at that stage .
Our room was on the 5th floor to the back of the hotel which got the sun for most of the day , looked down on the back of the hotel and onto the next street on which C A is located .
There was no balcony but the window doors opened in with a railing outside .
If you are to the front of the hotel , there is a very small balcony with standing room only .
The street is not very wide and you only get the sun in the evening .
Breakfast : This is served until 11am during the week , later at the week - end .
It comprises of juices , cereals ( no cornflakes ) , cold meats , cheeses , fresh fruits , scrambled eggs , mini saugages , crispy bacon , bread rolls , bread to be toasted , yogurts , danish pastries and doughnuts .
We arrived down for breakfast at 10 . 30am to see a waitress taking plates of what looked like really nice shortcake cookies , we presumed to a different location in the breakfast room .
We soon realised that they were clearing away and these were not available when we would have liked them with our coffee and tea to finish .
If you like coffee there 's no problem but if you like tea , like me , they bring a cup of warm water and a tea bag .
You get the milk from the large jug for the cereal .
Most 4* star hotels we have stayed in have teapots and small jugs for cold milk which make it much more user friendly .
Pulitzer Management please take note .
Restaurant : Not open Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday nights .
Having stayed previously in the AC Diplomatic which is a further 5 / 10 mins away from Pl . Catalunya , We are still undecided which is better overall ! ! ! !
Hotel Jazz hit a sour note .
I was very disappointed in the service we received from some of the front desk people .
I accidentally left a scarf and leather jacket at the hotel .
I requested they send it to me , at my expense and after I confirmed w / the staff that they had it .
It was never returned .
This hotel also does n't have an onsite restaurant that offers lunch or dinner .
There were thankfully places around to eat , but it would have been convenient to have onsite options .
Lastly , when we arrived , the woman at the front desk complained to us that we had too much luggage .
Well , there were four of us and everyone had a bag .
Not a great way to welcome patrons .
Good not great .
We stayed at the Jazz for a family break having read the reviews on Tripadvisor .
Had 2 rooms - a double and a triple corner suite ( for the kids ) .
Nice modern decor .
Staff helpful ( ordered a 7 seater taxi etc ) and spoke good English .
The location is good and if you have a skateboarder in the party ( as we did ) it is very convenient for several of the better spots ( MACBA , Universitat , one stop on metro to Paral . lel , etc ) .
The position is a bit noisy and the breakfasts are quite expensive ( though very good as well ) .
So overall , we thought it was a good choice but not the best ever .
We 'd use it again .
High tech nice hotel .
We stayed here for 2 nights waiting for our cruise ship embarkation .
The lobby is pretty and the room ( deluxe double ) had a nice view of the beach , was very high tech with automatic blinds , music throughout the room and a beautiful modern bathroom .
Decor was neutral , and attractive .
We arrived from the airport at 10 in the morning and had to wait until 3:00 for our room to be ready .
This is our only complaint .
Eventhough check out was noon .
They had a nice welcome lounge with free food and drinks and we were given a nice tour of the amazing spa ( did n't use it ) and access to the pool and changerooms .
The art / sculptures throughout were attractive .
We paid less than 300 euros / night for the room which was reasonable .
There was one 15 metre pool ( nice large hammocks and loung chairs surrounding it ) as well as a smaller almost like a wading pool .
The atmosphere was relaxing with green apples and bottles of water available at the pool .
We had to wait for a lounge chair in the shade one day .
The food was excellent especially the buffet breakfast . Nicely presented and huge selection including asian choices for breakfast .
It was near the beach and many restaurants and not too far from shopping ( short taxi ride ) .
Staff were very helpful although the front desk was a little snooty .
The concierge were helpful in suggesting restaurants and calling for us .
They have greeters who show you to your room and how to use things in your room . It was a nice touch .
We enjoyed ourselves and if we went to Barcelona again we would stay here .
Excellent Position , Spotlessly Clean .
My sisters and I have just returned from spending 3 nights in the Hotel Royal .
Reviews on this site had recommeded requesting a room at the front but when we did so , we were informed that all triple rooms were at the back .
However , the room was very spacious , comfortable and clean , and being on the fourth floor was quiet enough that we could have our window open all night .
The hotel is in a fantastic position , and it was easy for us to pop in and out during the day to deposit bags of shopping and freshen up !
The best place to have breakfast is at the Nuria Restaurant which is just a few doors up the Ramblas , next to Burger King .
Just 6 euros for a full English breakfast .
We would definitely stay in this hotel again .
Bang On .
Stayed July 13 to15 2005 .
The staff especially SARA were very helpful by recommending tapas bars and resturants as well as going over the maps they gave us on tourist sites .
The room was right on Las Ramblas and when you closed the sliding doors it was very quiet .
The bathroom had a large jacuzzi tub with robes and slippers .
The bed was top notch , and the room very clean and tastefully decorated .
I cannot believe this is a three star hotel , I have stayed in good 4 and 5 star hotels that do not even come close to this .
The price is very good for the quality you get .
Just keepdoing what your doing well done
Terrific Hotel .
Great hotel , next to Estatio Sants station , accessed via train or aircoach from the airport .
You can not miss the 23 storey new hotel building as you exit the station It has a massive SONY radio aerial on the roof .
The hotel is very new so the owners may have built it to be ready for the extra visitors when the new high speed train from Madrid arrives .
That is the reason for the building work at the station .
We visited in Nov 07 and the work did not affect us at all .
Terrific cheap buffet in the station restaurant which we used prior to departing on the way home .
We booked flights via EasyJet and the hotel via " eXcape with us " which gave us a good deal for four nights .
However , I tried for hours on the internet to seek a phone number for the hotel so I could ring and make sure our booking was on their system ( which I always do ) .
Reading the other reviews I came across the fact that the old 6 storey Expo hotel next door was in the same group .
Typed in expo hotels and voila ! - a telephone number - which is [ - - ] . The website is " expogrupo . com " ( and they own the fabulous Mare Nostrum resort in Tenerife ) .
When we arrived all the reception staff spoke excellent English and very really helpful .
We had booked a standard room because the eXcape site did not give the option of a superior room .
Reception told us standard rooms are up to floor 9 , and superior room floors 10 - 16 .
Floors 17 - 22 are more expensive and I think some are suites .
We chose floor 16 with panoramic views and paid 8 euros each per night extra , which matched what others were offering on the web .
Other reviews are accurate re the excellent facilities and restaurants so I will not repeat them here but instead give a little feedback on the city .
Barcelona is very much bigger than we envisaged but if you like walking you can see so much .
We walked in to the centre by different routes every day and in the evening came home by taxi for 拢5 .
There are three open topped bus tour routes , which if you did them all back to back would take a whole day .
However they are worth it especially the two day " hop - on , hop - off " ticket which we used .
There is a lot to see so get a cheap guide book and plan your visit .
Sagrada Familia is architecturally , simply stunning .
The maritime museum shows how Spain was able to navigate the world centuries ago .
There is a model of the Armada 's flagship - what must have been an awesome sight coming across the English Channel .
Regarding security , If you are sensible Barcelona is no more dangerous than London , Manchester , Leeds etc .
I wear Rohan or Meyer trousers both of which have zipped security pockets inside a front pocket , where I keep some money for the day .
I have sewn an internal security pocket ( 拢3 John Lewis ) inside the waist band where I keep passports and remainder of euros for the holiday .
My wife always wears her Eagle Creek secure handbag across her shoulder with zips closed .
Any self respecting pickpocket will go for the back pocket wallets and the open handbags which are in abundance .
Some people simply do not think - until it is too late and the wallet or purse has gone .
The hotel was always a nice place to return to in the evening , for a drink or meal in the bar or a nice relaxing bath .
For Barcelona , we recommend the Gran Hotel Torre Cataluna .
Hope this is helpful .

Great Location .
Not too much to say which has not already been said , nice , clean and very enjoyable stay , would recommend this hotel very good location and service spot on .
Unfortunately did not use the hotel aminities as I was out and about in Barcelona from start to finish and due to the location in the center .
Great hotel and fantastic city go and have brilliant time , some good clubs down by the sea .
Great hotel . . . but bad location .
We had booked into this hotel for 4 nights , and after reading the reviews on this site , requested a room on a high floor at the back of the hotel .
When we arrived the hotel did assign us a room on the 8th floor , but one at the front of the hotel .
The noise from the busy road and accompanying roadworks was very loud , and kept us awake most of the night .
We requested a move first thing the next morning , but they could n't offer us an alternative room as the hotel was full .
We checked out and moved to another hotel .
If your sleep is important to you , we would not recommend this hotel .
However , we had a fantastic meal in the hotel restaurant and the hotel itself is very modern and clean and our room was quite spacious . Just very noisy !
Cool hotel .
Bathroom
Nice hotel but needs to repair some features .
Broken Table
Nice location at decent price , but you can find better value in Barcelona .
The hotel is in a good location ( near all the main attractions and near the underground ) but the area is not great and the rooms are just ok .
Considering that in Barcelona you can find very stilish hotels at good prices I think this is not the best value hotel .
Hotel Jazz or Hotel Soho are more stylish , albeit a bit more expensive .
Nothing bad about this hotel but the room furniture is very ordinary , and very much like a NH hotel , which is a more downmarket spanish chain .
I think NN hotels are supposed to be more upmarket and more stylish , so this one is a bit of a disappointment in this sense .
However personnel was very nice and the location is good , my complaints relate only to the furniture .
Nice but noisy .
The Barcelona Universal has an excellent location 20 metres from the Parral . lel subway station .
Its a 10 minute walk to the foot of Las Ramblas , the same to the Gothic Quarter and 20 minutes to Port Vell .
The staff speak excellent English and are very helpfull .
The Hotel is only 3 years old .
The rooms are well designed , very clean and spacious enough .
The only problem is the wooden floors and lack of sound proofing .
We were woken on a few occasins by people above us either talking loudly ( not shouting ) or worse , taking a leak !
God forbid if the person above you has high heels and starts walking around at 03:00 in the morning .
If it was n't for this I would have given this hotel a 4 rating .
A couple of things to note :
1. As mentioned by others , this hotel has interior rooms with no window .
We asked for a room at the back of the hotel with a window and were accomodated ( we wanted a higher floor with a room facing Avenida Parrallel , but there were none left ) .
2 . The hotel pool is more od a plunge pool , not a swimming pool .
3 . Dont bother with the hotel breakfast .
Walk outside , turn left , proceed 50 metres and go into the cafe that sits under the hotel next door .
Good service , coffee and reasonable breakfasts .
Poor Arts has had its day .
Cracks are clearly appearing in the Arts and it is in need of an overhaul .
I have stayed here a few times .
Last time in January with my wife and this time on business .
In Jan we went for it and booked an expensive Club Room for a romantic weekend .
This gives you access to the Club floor with breakfast and drinks thrown in . Or should do .
One morning they effectively kicked my wife out of breakfast because they thought she was not from the club rooms .
Despite apologies and rose petals on our bed we decided not to go back .
However , I have just been again for a business conference .
And that is what the Arts is all about - business conferences .
They do n't need to be good on service as most people are not paying the bills and wo n't even appreciate the service anyway .
Everyone gets drunk in the bar until 3am and the hotel makes money .
Even for business conferences it is a rip off - the amount they charge for basic business items is criminal .
In fairness some things do n't change . The design of the hotel , the rooms are holding up amazingly well , the food is very good , the conciege very good and the location is nice .
( beware of the many pickpockets in the area ) But the arts is neither trendy nor high rolling and there are many better hotels in Barcelona nowadays .
Fantastic place to stay .
I 've just returned from a short break in Barcelona with my Husband who had fortunately booked hotel H1898 , based upon previous trip advisor reviews .
We were not dissapointed , the public areas are decorated beautifully and are a lovely place , to sit and relax with a drink from the bar .
On the first night we arrived there was live jazz in the bar which only added to the atmosphere .
Our room was lovely ; modern decor , spotlessly clean and the bathrobes , toothbrushes , shaver were nice finishing touches .
We had breakfast in the hotel on both mornings of our stay and I would recommend taking the time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in the dining room which over looks the Rambalas .
The food was good , with lots of typically spanish dishes including a great tortilla .
The hotel is in the centre of the Rambalas yet is quiet and peaceful inside , check in and check out , was quick and efficient and the staff were helpful and polite .
I would highly recommend this hotel , my only regret is that we could n't stay longer .
There must be better value than this in Barcelona !
Considering how expensive this hotel is , I do n't think it really offers the best quality available in Barcelona .
The hotel 's location is great and ( if the weather is good ) , the rooftop terrace is a great addition ( although the pool is probably better for kids to splash in rather than trying to actually swim in ) .
The beds are big ( generally queen size ) but the rooms are a tad on the small side - especially at the lower end of the hotel 's scale .
I was surprised to be asked to pay for a stamp when I asked the reception desk to post a letter on my behalf - hotels of this standard rarely ask for the price of a stamp .
The restaurant ( Drolma ) is fantastically expensive ( min . €50 for a starter or main ! ) , but I subsequently learnt it has a Michelin star and the food is incredible - well worth the experience .
My tip - go for the set menu , which is good value for money .
Drinks , for a restaurant of this quality were surprisingly reasonable ( around €8 a glass ) .
Stylish , hip and classy .
We just got back from the Pulitzer .
It is stylish , perfect location and perfect lounge with great service .
Go there !
Perfect stay in Barcelona .
My husband and I just returned from this hotel this week , stayed June 2nd , 3rd and 4th .
The hotel exceeded our expectations .
We loved the decor and the welcoming staff as we checked in .
We stayed in a superior room and I would recommend that , the other rooms we peeked in seemed a little small .
Our room also faced La Rambla , with absolutely no worries of hearing the street noise at night .
We absolutely loved the upstairs outdoor pool and bar on the top floor of the hotel , great for relaxing and having a glass of wine to watch the sunset .
We did this as soon as we checked in !
This is a romantic setting , that I will never forget .
Our plug did not work either in our bathroom , not sure what the deal is with that , but I just used another plug , hopefully they are working on that .
We loved the hotel all around . Swanky , but in our opinion comfortable - not pretentious at all .
I would recommend , you will not be disappointed .
My husband and I travel a lot for work and throughout Europe , so we have a very good idea of what works and if we ever went back to Barcelona , this is where we would stay .
Other tips . . Restaurants . . . Taller de Tapas , EXCELLENT for Tapas . Also , PLA . . . . great small romantic place for dinner . Great food too . . . Both are in the Barrio Gottic . walking distance to both .
Laura and Bryce SchaeferTemecula , CA
Fab choice for Barcelona !
Booked Hotel 1898 based on previous TA reviews and was not disappointed !
It 's all been said before - what more can I add ? !
If you arrive at the airport , just take the airport bus from immediately outside the Terminal door ( 3.90 Euros per person ) as it takes you right into Plaza Catalunya and it 's just a short walk round to La Rambla and a couple of blocks down on the right you 'll find the hotel .
The Hotel is actually an old building ( which used to house the Philipine Tobacco company ) but was beautifully restored just 2 years ago .
We paid 199 Euros per night for a classic room ( supposedly their most basic but it was perfect ) .
Our room faced onto an inner courtyard and was very peaceful .
To re - iterate previous reviews , all the positive points of the Hotel : location , interior design , spacious public areas , lovely rooftop terrace , beautiful rooms and bathrooms immaculately clean .
Two ( very tiny ) negative points - ( but in no way should it stop you from booking ! ) :
the hairdryer was a bit cumbersome and awkward to use , and , while the rooftop terrace is a huge asset in a city centre hotel , the number of loungers is a bit limited .
However , after a day 's walking sightseeing , this is a lovely relaxed area with cushioned benches to flop with one of their marvellous glasses of sangria !
The breakfast was 19 Euros each - a bit pricey but the quality was excellent ( cereals , freshest of fruit , pastries , breads , smoked salmon , cheeses , meats , omelettes made to order etc . )
We also used the Royal Hotel just up the road - good value at 9 Euros but not quite the same quality .
There is also a Starbucks attached to the hotel if you just fancy a coffee and a muffin one morning .
Further down La Rambla , La Boqueria food market is wonderful for a walk round - and you could just pick up fresh fruit , pastries etc there !
4 restaurants tested and definitely able to recommend , none too far from Hotel 1898:1 .
Can Culleretes , C / Quintana 5 ( oldest restaurant in Barcelona and cheap too ) .
2 . Taller de Tapas , C / Argenteria 51 ( very busy but good tapas ) .
3 . Els Quatre Gats , C / Montsio3 ( full of character and live music too ) .
4 . Les Quince Nits , Plaza Reial ( popular with the locals too ) .
Things to do ( some obvious ! ) : open top bus tour ( 23 Euros for 2 days with Bus Turistic ) , walk down La Rambla watching all the street entertainment , take the lift to the top of the Columbus monument .
Visit some of Gaudi 's buildings ( Casa Batllo , La Pedrera , Sagrada Familia ) , visit the Museu D ' Historia for a great insight into Roman Barcelona , visit Poble Espanyol to see the different Spanish styles of building and see the different crafts , tour round FC Barcelona stadium .
I actually think Barcelona would be a great place to take children too - apart from the places already mentioned , there 's the beach , zoo , aquarium etc !
I will definitely go back , and will definitely book Hotel 1898 again !
Enjoy !
fantastic stay .
The Pulitzer was recommended to me by a colleague who had stayed there .
We stayed for 4 nights in a superior room .
I did look at some of the reviews before I went and was n't sure what to expect .
We had a fantastic stay and loved the hotel .
Our room was excellent , yes they are narrower than avereage but they are finished very well .
It was the best bed I have slept in away from home .
The bathroom was lovely as well .
I had a look in a standard room which was v similar just a little shorter .
The communal lounge / bar is a lovely space .
V relaxing , an oasis of calm in a very busy town .
The restaurant is equally nice and breakfast was very fresh with a good selection of hot and cold food .
We also ate there one night and the standard was equally as good .
There is a nice outside terrace area as well .
There is a great roof terrace bar which is open from 6 onwards .
The over all experience was excellent .
We are pretty fussy about where we stay and the standards of service we expect and the team at ther Pulitzer surpassed them .
The stay were very friendly and polite and its a v central location .
Wiorst Experience Ever Stay Away ! ! ! ! ! !
You need to read this if you are thinking of staying at this hotel .
Ok , we stayed at this hotel for part of our honeymoon in Barcelona .
Location is good and rooms are ok but nothing great for the money .
Our last night there after we just went to sleep around 3 AM we hear shouting in the hallway .
Then there is this load banging on our door from a girl screaming in some foreign language .
Of course we didnt know what to do so we just waited and we heard banging on the door next to us .
This goes on for like 5 minutes and I didnt want to open the door because I dont know who is out there and what their issue is , so I call the front desk .
Front desk tells me that some crazy lady got on the elevator before they could stop her and they are aware she is in the hotel .
I tell the guy well shes is banging as hard as she can on my door and the rooms next to me on the third floor so please have her removed .
He says ok and that he also called the police .
This baging goes on literally for the next 45 minutes .
This lady is crying , screaming , and banging on our door and the rooms next to us so loud that I honestly felt she was going to break the door down .
I called the front desk again , same guys there and no action is taken .
Finally around 4:14 AM the banging stops and we try to go back to sleep but with all that happening and it being so loud and odd I probably got 1 hour of sleep before I had to wake up and get my plane .
So the next morning I go to check out while my wife finishes gathering things in the room .
I ask to talk to the owner .
A middle aged man downstairs said he is the owner .
He spoke some English and I explained to him in English and Spanish about what happened .
He said he was aware of it and it was a lady and a husband or boyfriend that have stayed there before that were in a fight , which was very different then the story I heard the night earlier about some random crazy walking in off the street .
I explained it was our heoneymoon and we paid a lot for the hotel and I didnt think we should need to pay for the last night becuase of what happened .
You dont pay $ 300 / night to stay at a hotel and have that kind of experience .
I own 3 different businesses in the US and any other business owner would agree that some sort of action should be taken by the owner of this hotel for his guests .
Well this guy flipped out .
Came around the desk and started yelling and screaming with his fist in the air that we better pay for all the nights . This guy was crazy .
So to wrap this up , he actually grabbed me by the shirt at least three times and tried to shove me , kicked our bags and our $ 1500 worth or artwork we purchased in Barcelona the day before that was wrapped in a bix that said fragile , tried to have a bell boy take our bags , and just acted like a real ass .
I told him we would have the cops come and they could see the videotape of what just happened .
he had one of his workers go in the back room and do something ( Im pretty sure get rid of the tape ) .
The police came which were little help .
I told them to watch the tape .
They came back 5 minutes later and told me it was out of order .
I filed a police report there becuase they advised me it would take too long to go to the police station .
We ended upo missing our flight anyways and now I am disputing the charge for the hotel on my credit card because of all this .
What a way to treat your guests after they are put through a night of screaming and yelling by other guests outside of your room .
Especially when you know how much they are paying a nigh to stay there and that it is your honeymoon .
Stay away from this place .
Only thing good about it is the location .
Services suck .
Cant even get ice unless the bar is open and then you need to walk downstairs and have them go get you some .
Not worth it .
Trust me .
Rest of hte trip was great .
Z This place ruined Barcelona for us .
What a gem !
Your search for a hotel stops here !
Do not hesitate in making a reservation at this place . . . we can not fault it at all .
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of the month .
We were only on the 3rd floor and overlooked the street and the traffic did n't bother us at all so I ca n't understand how people on the 8th floor were troubled by ' noise ' .
Ok , so it was a busy street but I did n't think it was that bad . . . some morning 's we even slept through until 11 having tired ourselves out the previous day exploring what Barcelona has to offer .
Admitedly there always seemed to be police / ambulance sirens going off but working in the centre of London from Monday to Friday , it 's something you become immune to and so it did n't affect us .
The hotel itself was amazing - our first impression was that we 'd walked into the wrong place as it seemed so grand for our ' budget city break ' .
The rooms are very spacious with great air conditioning and facilities .
We tried breakfast at the hotel one morning but as someone else has mentioned EUR13 was relatively steep for what you got .
In a cafe just a few doors along to the left you could have an ' american ' comprising of 2 fried eggs , sausage , 2 bacon , toast , tea or coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice for EUR8 . . . that kept our stomach 's full well into the day .
Regardless of where you go exploring , there 's plenty of mini supermarkets and bakeries so if ever we felt peckish at lunchtime we simply popped into those for a freshly baked french stick and cheese .
Right outside the hotel doors is the entrance for Paral . lel station which offers great links to almost anywhere .
Their train maps are very clear so you 'll never get lost .
Go one stop to Drassanes and you 'll find yourself down by the port and Mare Magnum shopping centre , where there 's plenty of restaurants on offer .
If you are a fish lover , one of our faves was Emperadors where a three course dinner with wine , water and coffee for two cost us 拢45 .
Another , situated actually within the shopping centre , was Mandongo , an oriental - come - spanish mix where , again , the food and staff were delightful .
We did n't even bother with cabs to and from the airport .
A 5 / 10 minute walk from the terminal along a signposted route brings you to the train station where a journey of 20 mins costing EUR 2.5 takes you to Sants station , which in turn is only a few stops on the underground to Paral . lel .
Their underground is also airconditioned ( unlike London ) so travelling around on that is great , especially if you want to escape from the daytime heat .
We did n't bother with tour buses or anything as our 5day Barcelona Card for EUR 30 got us literally everywhere .
We purchased our card once we reached Sants station .
It entitles you to discounts and free entry to many attractions so it 's a great money saver .
We hopped on and off ( normal ) buses and trains to our hearts content and explored so much .
All in all , we 'd say Barcelona is a top place for a city break .
Plenty to see and do and for a reasonable price if you plan wisely .
There 's plenty of websites with constantly changing deals on hotels ( we booked through hotels . com ) plus flights with Easyjet lower your overall cost too ( we got return flights for 拢90 each ) .
Do n't hesitate in booking this hotel . . . .
it 's well worth the money !
Excellent Front of House Team .
A group of us stayed here for a friends 40th Birthday in December .
Great location , excellent front office team , especially Amanda , great bar .
The rooms were on the small side and if I stayed again would book a superior as these were bigger .
The lighting in the bedrooms and bathrooms does need improving as not easy to do make up in poor light .
Overall we had a great weekend
Nice but not 5 star .
Great location lovely features .
Ca n't agree with reviews about good service - once booked in I felt we were forgotten .
Maybe Spanish 5 star but this hotel is probably 3 star plus for us Brits .
E - mailed hotel twice before I arrived explaining we were celebrating our silver anniversary was surprising my wife with choice of hotel to help arrange restaurant bookings upgrade rooms - both e - mails were ignored .
Towels bath - robes hard , not fluffy like they should be .
No tea / coffee making facilities disappointing .
Our first visit to Barcelona was still fantastic - will return but not to the Majestic .
avoid " classic " rooms .
We left that property with very mixed emotions .
The reason for booking it was the exceptional location : close to everything within walking distance there is no better choice under that point of view .
But apart from that I think that there is no reason to stay there .
My wife arrived a day before me , being a young , single travelling women .
Was it a coincidence that she was given the room next to the elevator , courtyard facing with a very strange , convoluted layout with a small window in the corner between the bathroom and the wall , so it was like a room without a window ?
Of course somebody has to take the bad rooms , but why allocate it to somebody who has booked for 5 days and not to somebody who just spends there one night ?
So we were given another room .
As we opened the door , a wave of very bad , acidic smell came out .
We called the front desk and the person who came round wrinkled his nose and admitted , that there was a terrible smell , assuming that it was the new carpet of the remodelled room .
Well , if their new carpets smell like this , I dont want to know about the old ones .
Room number three , not expecting much anymore , was very small too .
Between the bed and the bathroom there was the desk with a minibar , a small table with two chairs and the closet with a rack for a small suitcase .
Furnished like this , there was no space for putting a regular suitcase on the floor leaving space for walking around it so that we either had to close it and put it uprigth or climb over it when we wanted to go to the bathroom .
Truly exciting when you have to get up at night .
Now we definitiely were ready for a drink .
But the minibar / refrigerator was not working .
As we do not like warm drinks we called for ice cubes ( no ice - machines in the corridor ) and maintenance .
The electrician arrived before the waiter and fixed it .
Than the ice - bucket came and we were informed , that we had to pay 5 Euros for it .
For a bucket we needed , because the fridge was broken and the drinks were too warm ?
In a 5 star property ?
Come on , that 's realy bad style and cheesy .
Beeing very small , the air in the room was sticky .
Usually we like to leave the windows open .
But in this case we preferred not to , because the fire stairs were crossing the window .
So we switched on the A / C .
There was air coming out of the outlet but it was warm .
We put the thermostat to the minimum , but still only warm air .
We asked several times for reparation at the front desk , but nothing happened .
Why not offer to have another room with a working A / C ?
The best thing about the room was the housekeeping . Very efficient and immaculatly clean all the time .
The toilet was tucked between the washbasin and the wall so that one had to squeeze himself diagonally on it .
The lobby , bar and restaurant were very stylish and arranged tastefully .
The breakfast room is located in the basement ( no windows ) .
The food - quality was very good and the service very efficient .
On our visits the breakfast room was crowded and the acoustics were quiet bad so that the overall experience was not very pleasant .
The female front - desk staff were very nice and helpful , whereas male stuff were rather presumptuos .
Example ?
We were asking for directions one morning , when suddenly the employee turned away from us starting a conversation with somebody more interesting than us .
Probably the stay would have been better , if we had booked a de luxe room ( 130 Euros more per night ) .
But how could we know before ?
When booking in a 5 - Star property one can expect a certain size and standard even in the least expensive room .
But the " classic " rooms in my opinion are definitely substandard in terms of size , layout and location .
Of course in the hotels website it 's noticed that they are only " approximately 20 square meters " ( they should add , that they are dark and the samll window only gives a view in a grim courtyard ) what would be barely acceptable if of regluar shape .
But in such a tubular or strange layout , it 's much worse and clearly not acceptable .
In my opinion , the very narrow rooms I have seen , should only be furnished with a small bed and sold as single rooms only , as for two persons they defintively are unreasonable in a 5 - Star property .
Next time in Barcelona we will go somewhere else .
Nice hotel , staff somewhat lacking .
Very nice , clean , modern hotel .
Excellent roof top pool ( weather permitting ) .
Staff not very enthusiastic , helpful or proactive , apart from the boys in the bar , who were friendly when approached first .
Better for couples with an idea of what they want out of Barcelona .
The room was n't huge , but was very nice .
In Aussie dollar terms , value for money was ok , but not great .
We were just dissapointed with lack of staff interest - did not help us get to know Barcelona at all .
Mind you , we did not encounter many friendly locals in a 7 day stay .
Is anyone working in Barcelona actually from Barcelona ?
No one seems to be local , and none of them seem to like it there .
We stayed in Apartments in many other cities , and should have done so here , as the hotel staff were of no real help at all .
Great showers , nice room , average hotel .
We stayed at the Arts for a long weekend having attended a conference at the hotel .
Rooms are wonderful - large , well finished with the usual extras ( BO TVs , etc ) and they have particularly nice the bathrooms - the shower was one of the best I have had in a hotel - really excellent .
However the hotel has a peculiar layout and the reception and public areas felt cramped .
Oftentimes it had the feeling of a train station . . .
There are 6 lifts going up to the bedrooms however the wait for the lifts was very long - It was frustrating waiting on lifts and the infrequency of them meant that every time I used them they were packed full of people - making the short journey pretty unpleasant . . .
The hotel is near the Marina , which is great if you want to be near the beach , but is not in the centre of things . . .
If you want to see the sights and sounds of Barcelona there are more central hotels .
NOT so Grand !
I depended very much on the TripAdvisor reviews when I booked this hotel for me and my wife .
The reviews were so ecstatic , I was positive that this would be the perfect hotel for our trip to Barcelona .
Our experience was pretty far from perfect .
I feel that I need to write a review that will balance out the glowing reviews that this hotel has been receiving as a fair warning to my fellow travelers who also depend on and love TripAdvisor .
In the three nights we stayed at the Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya , we had a poor overall experience .
Firstly , the standard rooms are average .
Barely 4 stars , I found the standard room dark , stuffy and pretty grim .
While indeed close to a train / subway station , the hotel 's location also felt far from much of Barcelona 's cultural attractions .
Be prepared for a five - seven minute walk to the station plus a 15 - 20 minute ride to get to any major attraction .
Prior to our third day at the hotel ( covered here in just a bit ) the staff members were fine . Not overly helpful or friendly , the service they provided met , but did not exceed expectations for the prices we paid .
Our trip happened to coincide with Holy Week 2008 and our last day was Good Friday , a pretty major holiday in Barcelona .
Not knowing what sites might have limited hours on Good Friday , we planned an early start to our day .
We asked the hotel for a 7:30 am wake up call on Friday morning .
We received no call .
Instead , a bellhop knocked on our door at 9:40 am as a wake up call .
He explained that he was sent because there was no answer to a call to our room at 7:30 am .
Our first thought was that we definitely did not miss a call at 7:30 because the phones were extra loud .
Our second thought was , Why , if we were supposed to receive a 7:30 call , was the bellhop now standing at our door at 9:40 ?
Not wanting to take it out on the messenger , I thanked the bellhop and told him I would be taking it up with the hotel management .
At the lobby we explained the situation to the manager in charge .
She initially seemed dubious of our story , perhaps believing that we really did miss a 7:30am call .
Because we persisted , she eventually called the person responsible for the wake up calls .
They admitted to her , she explained , that they simply forgot to call us .
Needless to explain further , this was a frustrating situation having already lost a good few hours in our last full day in Barcelona .
To make up for the issue , the manager offered to upgrade our room for the last night .
They did follow through with this gesture which we are appreciative of .
However , I ca n't help but feel let - down by my overall experience at the Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya .
Great - but 1 Major problem .
Beautiful hotel on one of the best shopping streets .
I booked throughthe hotels website and choose a Superior room .
Staff we really helpful and kind .
Now for the problem - our Queen size bed was actually 2 single beds , although the website does say queen size or twin beds when you pay over 1000Euro for a 3 night stay ( room only ) you dont expect to wake up on the floor after falling through the middle of them on the first night .
Horrible Service , Nice Building .
My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 in early Oct . 2007 .
I am a frequent business traveler both within the US and internationally and have experience with many hotels ( Four Seasons , Starwood , Ritz Carlton , etc . . . ) .
Hotel 1898 is part of a chain of upscale boutique hotels in Spain .
The pluses are that the hotel is in nice condition with clean rooms and good looking common spaces ( including 2 pools ) .
Our experience was ruined , however , by the incredibly unhelpful staff at Hotel 1898 who seemed to go out of their way to be outright rude to us - for instance , my wife called to ask if the conceirge could make a dinner reservation for us .
Four hours later , we had heard nothing so she called again .
The concierge responded by snapping that they were very busy and would call when they got around to it - by the time they did , the restaurant was fully booked .
Another major problem was that the Hotel was simply mismanaged - although the check - in time was 3pm , the hotel refused to check us in at that time saying that the rooms were not clean .
We were not able to check in until over two hours later and the hotel offered us no recompense for this significant inconvenience aside from one drink at the bar .
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as the service is horrendous .
Nice clean hotel .
Booked this hotel for a getaway city - trip with my wife .
Modern new hotels .
Staff was Ok , but nothing more than that .
Impeccable clean room .
Everything quite new .
No problems whatsoever .
Breakfast OK too .
Very well situated near metro , and within walking distance ( 10 ' ) from Ramblas .
This hotel offers all the modern comfort any reasonable traveller cal expect .
Good value for money .
Very good until the Brits arrived .
I 'm giving the hotel a good review as I think that on the whole it was very good .
Everything said in these reviews was accurate : the room was very clean and well presented , the position was great for us ( I had stayed in the middle of the Barri Gotic before , but preferred it here , as we got to go North to the Gracia area as well ) , and breakfast was very good .
The concierge gave 2 excellent restaurant reviews , including Patagonia steakhouse and the El Raco which was 2 minutes away , very unusual , tasty and well priced .
All in all , it 's usually worth asking , as their recommends were always better than our gos at finding somewhere to eat !
Took the Bus Turistic for 2 days ( only 23 Euros per person for 2 days , which was a bargain ) and had some lovely strolls around the Barri Gotic and the areas around the hotel .
The rooftop pool was also very nice , and we had some very peaceful afternoons up there ( watch out for the bird scarer - scares the begeebies out of you first time ! ) .
On our fourth day , our afternoon by the pool was ruined by a large group of Brits who ( as we have seen so many times before on holiday ) acted like they owned the place , behaved very badly , were loud , drunk and did not attempt to control their children ( one of whom threw a ball off the 9th floor onto the street below ) .
It completely spoiled our afternoon , although we understand that this was not the fault of the hotel .
As we were checking out , we noticed that a large British Hen Party were checking in , so we can only think that we timed that right .
When will Brits abroad start to understand that there are other people around , and that a little consideration goes a long way .
Anyway , please do n't let this put you off this very good hotel .
We would def return .
Great rooftop pool .
What a superb hotel , lived up to our expectations .
Every amenity you could wish for , lovely spa pool downstairs , bar , restaurant and the icing on the cake the rooftop pool .
Much to my delight I was told when we checked in that the rooftop pool was heated .
Being rather a fan of rooftop pools I 'd been looking for a heated one for our stay in January , but could n't find much detail on websites .
Yes , the bar was a bit expensive , but this is the best hotel ( in my opinion ) on La Rambla , right in the heart of things .
The breakfast was excellent , but try and track down a BB rate .
Overall I am a tough customer to please , but I could n't find fault with anything , apart from having to come home !
Not bad , not great .
My partner and I stayed here for a long weekend .
In the past we have usually taken the cheap pension option in the centre of town and I have to say having tried a five star option , I would sincerely recommend the pension downtown .
You are a bit detached from the buzz of the city in the harbor and you do n't really get a feeling for a place as alive as Barcelona in a five star luxury hotel .
The goods are , the place is nicely decorated , Bose sound systems etc .
The staff at reception are very nice .
The restaurants are a bit pricey but excellent .
Just what you would expect form a top flight hotel .
The bads , we had a couple of issues with them messing up our room service lunch and brining the wrong dishes .
They eventually replaced the wrong dishes but it meant we had our starters after our desserts .
At 120 Euro for lunch a good hotel would have taken the whole thing away and delivered us what we asked for .
Finally , they did not replenish the coffee making facilities for the 3 days we stayed , had to keep phoning them for coffee .
All in all nothing major wrong or right but I just did n't click with the hotel like you do with others .
Location Great !
Experience Fantastic .
What a great hotel !
The staff were excellent , very helpful .
They knew they 're city and enough english to direct us were we needed to go .
The hotel is located just five minutes from the Columbus statue which is a great hub to catch transportation to any part of the city .
The roof top wadding pool and excercise room are small but we spent most of our time exploring the city .
The rooms are spacious and clean .
Everything was very modern and I would stay there again anytime I 'm in Barcelona .
A Decent Stay .
My partner and I stayed here recently for 2 nights and enjoyed the hotel ( booked it primarily because of the great reviews on tripadvisor ) .
As for our experience , the hotel seemed quite new , which usually means a clean and modern decor , which we found to be true .
Although our room itself was a bit small for a superior room , it was sufficient for our purposes .
The room was equipped with free wifi access , an LCD tv ( but with only one english channel , no movies or DVD ) , a minibar , safe stand - up shower / bath .
Did n't use room service so I ca n't comment on that .
The decor was quite cool and on the funky side , definitely comfortable .
The spa facility was only basic and as such , I would n't recommend it ( poor changing lounge area , small but neat looking pool with unisex sauna / steam and a couple of treadmills to account for a gym ) .
We had a massage which was okay but not remarkable .
Overall , the price is reasonable for what 's offered and we would consider staying here again .
I 'd suggest this hotel is a solid 3 1 / 2 star ( would be a 4 if they took some of the details up a notch ) .
Great hotel !
Would go back .
Our group of 4 ( two teenagers plus my niece and myself ) rented 2 rooms on the 15th floor of this great hotel on December 28 .
Super - sized , non - smoking rooms , wonderful bathroom , great sheets , towels , bathrobes and slippers .
We had a view of the Tibidabo from our rooms .
The 10 euro breakfast on the top floor with fantastic views of Barcelona was well worth the money .
The rooms were 100 euros / night ( plus taxes and extras ) which I thought was reasonable .
Helpful and polite staff .
Offered maps and directions to my favorite tapas places ( Cafeteria Catalu帽a and Ciudad Condal ) No noise at night except for the odd ambulance or police car .
I was hesitant to book so far from the Ramblas / Gotico area , but then decided that if what I could afford was out of the Ramblas area , then it might as well be well - communicated via train or metro , hence the choice near the Sants station .
We liked it so much that we went back to the hotel for their 13 euro , three course menu del dia in the lounge on the ground floor before leaving town .
Great for travelers arriving by train , just a short walk across the plaza , but also good for those arriving by car from southern points as you just have to turn right off of Diagonal onto Numancia and go down a few blocks .
No getting trapped in busy Barcelona traffic .
The parking lot is under the hotel and there is a hefty daily fee , but that is normal in all hotels I called in Barcelona .
This is a large , contemporary hotel , so if you are looking for quaint , typically Spanish style , you might try elsewhere .
It was perfect for us !
OK hotel , great location .
I booked the Pulitzer on their Website , after reading the reviews here .
It is in a terrific location , on a safe street just steps off the main plaza .
We had some minor problems , though .
Our first room had non - functioning air conditioning and a dirty toilet .
The staff switched us to another room that evening , which had the best shower I 've ever experinced in Europe , except that it did n't drain , almost to the point of flooding the bathroom .
That was fixed the next day , so the staff did their best for us .
We found the stylish recessed spotlights throughout the hotel to be quite dim , especially entering the hotel from the sunny street .
We loved Barcelona , and although I 'm not sorry we stayed at the Pulitzer , I 'd try another hotel next visit .
Superb hotel !
We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and it gave us everything we needed .
Rooms were comfortable , modern and clean .
The location was good , close to shops and restaurants .
The staff were excellent , extremely helpful whenever needed and always greeted us on entrance .
We took advise from other reviews and requested a room above the 4th floor to lessen any street noise .
This I guess worked because we were not bothered by anything , also I believe the streets were less busy during the time of year we visited .
All in all , could n't have asked for more !
First class hotel in a great location .
The hotel lobby area
very close to metro but restaurant dissappointing .
hi Just returned from bank holiday weekend in Barcelona , fabulous city , picked this hotel following reviews on trip advisor .
hotel very clean , and rooms spacious , if yoiu like modern you will love it , very conveinent right beside metro / train station , now has tea coffee facilities in room and generally good only dissappointment was the visual restaurant very pricey and very small portions .
I went for a take away following dinner ( not good for vegetarians , my portion of pasta was smaller than a starter portion in Ireland ) Dublin Ireland
Not as ' majestic ' as it looks !
Have just returned from 3 nights at the Majestic in Barcelona .
We had booked 3 nights for the price of 2 with Last Minute , but most people on this site seem to have got a much better deal ! !
On arrival , it had the feel of a five star place - lovely lobby , stunning flower arrangments and a guy to greet us and carry our cases in .
These impressions were , in my opinion , about all that was 5 star about the place .
We were not lucky enough to be offered an upgrade to a junior suite , even though I explained that the trip was for my husband 's 50th - which it was , - consequently we had quite a small room ! ( I have stayed in larger rooms in a Premier Lodge in England , and that 's saying something ! )
The bathroom required the skills of an expert contortionist when getting in and out of the bath - you literally had to climb over the toilet .
You also needed elasticated arms to check the temperature of the water in the bath and shower , as the glass shower door is immoveable - because there is simply nowhere to move it to .
It was a real squash .
We also had to shift a table and two armchairs whenever we wanted to open the wardrobe !
Not my idea of 5 star ! .
Having said all of this , the room was clean , nicely decorated and regularly serviced .
The other thing that I found tricky was the traffic noise , but I suppose you should expect this in a big city .
We were on the 8th floor ( room 822 , if you wish to avoid it ! ! ! ) and could still hear the roar of the traffic . ( because I spend a lot of time in hotels when I work , I had earplugs , and even these di n't block the noise out entirely . )
We could also hear the conversations of the people in room 821 - word for word , actually , and I would n't have said that they were particularly raucous .
You could even hear them tapping their tooth brushes against the basin - and we are not serial evesdroppers , you just could n't miss it .
I thought the location of the hotel was good - very near a metro station and plenty of buses and cabs nearby .
We did n't take breakfast in the hotel , preferring a cafe down the road , with all the local people .
I liked the piano bar in the hotel , but as others have said , it was dear .
A beer and a glass of cava came to 15 euros .
However , I enjoyed the atmosphere in there and the piano guy was great .
We ate in the hotel restaurant one night .
This was a slightly surreal experience , as it was just us and one other couple , but the service was friendly , the wine and food were excellent , and we did n't have far to go after the meal was over !
Other places that we ate ( which we had chosen from The Rough Guide to Barcelona ) were El Glop , which was excllent , El Muscletaria ( fantastic place selling just - you guessed it - mussels - and also clams ) , and a fabulous , fabulous restaurant called ' anima ' , in which I had one of the best meals that I have ever had in my life .
All three restaurants were well worth seeking out , and were packed full of locals , so obviously not just for tourists !
I really , really enjoyed Barcelona , especially Parc Guell , the Gaudi House near to the Majestic Hotel , the Miro Fundacion and La Seu , with the views from the rooftop and the geese in the peaceful courtyard .
I would like to return to the city .
In truth I do not think I would stay at the Majestic again , as on this occasion I did not think we got what we paid for , and that would be my main gripe .
Maybe I was n't canny enough when I booked !
I would prefer to find a cheaper hotel that was a bit more honest about what it offered and was better value for money .
Horror Show .
I am an experienced traveler .
I travel for business and pleasure .
We take two vacations a year as a family .
Those vacations are for a period of seven to 20 days each .
My wife and I have used Tripadvisor for years .
She has posted in the past but I have only used the site for my edification and am writing today for the first time .
Our current travel experience has prompted me to write .
I almost always look askance at postings of a terrible experience at a hotel that has a high Tripadvisor rating assuming it was an aberration .
Alas , we are in the throws of such an experience at the Hotel 1898 in Barcelona , Spain .
We love Barcelona .
This is our second trip to the city .
On our first trip , we had a wonderful experience .
Great sites .
Great people .
I purchased one of my favorite pieces of original art from an artist in Barcelona which hangs in the entrance to our home .
Our second trip to Barcelona has been a horror show .
We came to the city for two days prior to a cruise .
Our flight from Boston was delayed 10 hours but we slept on the flight to Paris before our connection to Barcelona .
We looked forward to the Hotel 1898 as an oasis from the downside of travel .
Alas , Hotel 1898 was anything but an oasis .
My wife lost her passport .
We assumed she lost it in the Barcelona airport but her recollection is that she had it in the hotel room .
We take responsponsibility for not putting our cash and passports in the safe in our room .
The passport is missing along with 300 Euros .
It is a curious amount to be missing because it was three 100 euro bills that were taken from a larger sum of money and not all of the money was taken .
We have taken the position that we lost the passport and have not complained to the hotel .
We did ask them for their recommendation on what to do and they recommended we report the lost passport at the police station .
They also told us the police would give us a report that would allow us to travel .
I tipped the gentleman behind the desk 20 euro for his assistance .
We did as advised and the police were very accommodating .
We were told it will be up to the cruise line as to whether they let us board .
We chalked the downside of our trip up to the adage : - - - - happens and were ready to put the incident behind us for the rest of the evening .
Alas , that 's when we ran into a Barcelona we had not seen before .
In the lobby of the hotel is an oriental restaurant , La Xina .
We looked forward to a relaxing dinner in the hotel .
It was 10pm and we were told by the restaurant to return at 11pm for seating .
Upon our return we were told a table was not ready and that we should go up to the bar and they would let us know when a table was ready .
The bar consists of an oak runner around an open kitchen .
Four bottles of Moet and some wine were stacked in a plastic crate filled with ice .
There were no more than eight bottles of alcohol on the counter .
It looked more like a bar you would see at a house party .
I waited patiently while the young man made three frozen margaritas .
Just before he was done another man that worked at the restaraunt came up from downstairs with five young women in tow .
He stepped front of me and spoke to the bartender who nodded in return .
Upon finishing the margaritas and passing them to a waiter the bartender looked past me to the young women to take their order .
I politely said , Excuse me .
Without missing a beat , he told me he knew I was waiting but that he was told to wait on the women next .
I asked the matre d if the restaurant was affiliated with the hotel or unaffiliated ( I did not bother to complain ) . He told me it was unaffiliated .
One can not give one 's business to an establishment that could be so outwardly rude .
Our family went for pizza down the street .
When I travel I maintain low expectations and normally appreciate the courtesies extended to me and my family as guest saway from home .
The Hotel 1898 , and its unaffiliated restaurant , failed at meeting even the minimum standards .
Wonderful room .
appalling breakfast We had the corner suite . It was fantastic .
Great views , great comfort .
The Ritz Carlton showers are the best in the world .
However the breakfast , which is not included in the price , was an absolute joke . 110 for 4 people ! !
The choice was appalling every morning .
Cold , over salted scrambled egg , cold bacon .
Other than that it was just cakes or a few bits of fruit .
Never have I felt so ripped off in all my life .
AVOID THE BREAKFAST !
Other than this it was an enjoyable experience , though not as great as people make out in my opinion .
It was OK .
As the title suggests , it was OK , but just that .
The hotel is rated 4 - star , but as with all star - ratings , you never quite know what you 're going to end up with .
As locations go it is pretty good .
Right next to a metro station , and only 30 mins from the airport ( costing 70 cents if you get the 10 - journey ticket , amazing value ! )
Most places are easily accessible by the metro but , as we discovered only 2 days before we left , it 's better to get the bus to the beach , a number of which go from directly opposite the hotel and take about 15 mins .
As hotels go it is clean and fairly smart looking , but clearly business orientated , indicated not only by the corporate feel to it , but the steep price of breakfast ( 17 Euro ) and the lack of drinks facilities in the room , which was a shame .
Our first room was a twin , at the front of the hotel .
When I called down to be asked to move to a double ( which was booked ) there were no other rooms left , so the receptionist told us that we would be moved while we were out the following day , a minor inconvenience but acceptable .
When we returned to the hotel the following day I was reprimanded by the receptionist for not clarifying my request that morning .
Sadly , a case of one person saying one thing , and another doing another , an unfortuantely memorable event which could have easily been avoided .
Our double room , was 2 twins pushed together .
The beds were hard and uncomfortable , but thankfully our new room was at the back of the hotel , which was quieter and had better views .
Housekeeping at the property is acceptable , but inconsistent .
New towels one day , sometimes not the next day , bed made up one day , turned down the next .
Although the bathrooms were spotless !
Food Beverage at the hotel should be avoided .
The breakfast buffet and other menus are uninspiring , and the bar is so lacking in atmosphere that we only dared have one drink there , and we were the only people we saw all week in there .
Much more could be made of both of these outlets as there are few other nice places in the area .
And a word to the wise : if any restaurant has pictures of the food outside , keep well away .
It is definitely the tourist food !
I suppose overall while the hotel is modern and clean , I left with a feeling that no - one was really prepared to go the extra mile for guests , there was a distinct lack of passion .
We would n't go back there or recommend it because it simply was just average , and we found better places to stay whilst we were there .
Very Nice !
Stayed at this hotel for our 1st year anniversary .
We choose it because of the reviews from this website .
The hotel was very very nice , the staff are excellent .
It is a very modem hotel in a good loctaion .
We mailed the hotel and asked for a nice room , which they gave us with a brillinat view .
Very nice hotel in a great location !
We stayed here one night after our cruise .
The hotel is located within a short walk of many attractions in Barcelona .
The rooms are very large and modern .
The beds are a little firm , but other than that I was very impressed .
Elevator nightmare .
It is a wonderful hotel , with wonderful service , all the amenities , etc .
However , the elevators are so slow , that I think 20 % of my time in the hotel was spent waiting for them , trying to get my room key to work to make it go to the club floor , etc .
It was ridiculous - - and everyone in the hotel was complaining about it .
Make no mistake , this hotel is of the highest class , especially the club lounge , which is terrific , but I began to dread leaving my room for the elevators , because they were that bad .
nice rooms , extras way overpriced ( here is a sample price list ! ) .
Giving it 3 stars , because for a 5 star property , the hotel did not live up to expectations .
The rooms are wonderful ( 5 stars ) , the staff OK ( 4 stars ) , the restaurants I would not recommned ( 1 or 2 stars ) .
When I plan trips , I am always wondering what the extras cost at the hotel , so here are a few prices for you so that you can better plan your budget / trip .
50 minute massage = 120 Euros + 16 % tax 50 minute facial = 115 Euros + 16 % tax Coke from mini bar = 7 euros + 7 % tax Water from mini bar = 6 - 8 euros + 7 % tax Cup Cup of coffee coffee in room = 4 Euross + 7 % tax ( No , the coffee is not free ! ! ! )
Room service breakfast = 29 - 35 euros + 6 euro delivery charge + 7 % tax .
Room service sandwich = 22 - 24 euros + 6 euro delivery charge + 7 % tax
OK , you get the idea !
To get a sense of what things cost outside the hotel , a coffee and croissont at the cafe outside the hotel was 2 .
4 euros and large bottle of water usually costs 1.5 o3 2 euros .
A bottle of coke was 1.40 euros .
A sandwhich is between 3 - 6 euros usually .
I would mind paying so much at Hotel Arts if I felt like the quality and service met the prices , but sadly it did n't ( I could even eat my main course at the Marina Bar restaurant , it was so bland and tasteless and my friend hated his appetizer and could not eat it ) Also , while the hotel is near the beach , it is a bit away from the other sites .
A taxi to La Ribera / El Born ( great bars and restaurants ) is about 5 or 6 euros , about 7 - 10 to Las Ramblas .
The metro is 2 short blocks from the hotel , so I used that a lot .
Not loving the Grand Marina .
Our second time in Barcelona , previously we had stayed at the H10 Montcada and quite enjoyed it .
This time around we got what we thought was a great deal and chose to stay on the water .
We 're still here as I write this , but are thinking of cutting our reservation short perhaps to take a train to explore more of Spain .
I can see why those about to board a ship would choose this hotel , as it 's literally on the pier where you would board your ship .
The hotel design is cool and contemporary , but this is where the love stops .
It 's the little things that are driving me nuts .
Our room in on the 7th floor ( of 8 ) and we 've got a great view with a little tiny balcony that looks out to the city .
I really liked this until night came and the winds changed .
The sliding doors to the balcony do n't seem to close correctly , so you get this sporadic wind shrieking as you try to sleep .
Perhaps this is something that only happens in the winter ?
The temperature controls in the room seem useless .
No matter how I set it , it seems to jump back to 20 Celsius .
The only clock in the room is actually part of the flat panel TV . Once you shut off the TV , the clock can no longer be seen .
We were welcomed on arrival with a small plate of chocolates and some bottled water . Lovely .
But for a 5 - star luxury hotel , it would be nice if they would drop off a bottle of water every day .
The only alternative is the min - bar 's teeny - tiny 330ML bottles - that cost 4 Euros each .
We had wine glasses in the room on the first day as well , but those seem to have disappeared .
I 'm dying to find out what happens with the bathroom amenities today . We do n't seem to be getting anything replenished and are down to one tiny bar of soap that we keep passing between the shower and the sink .
It literally feels like the hotel is saying - you 've used up your allotment , time to check out .
On the bright side , we did partake in the morning buffet on our second day ( not included in our package ) . It was really lovely .
But unless you 're boarding a cruise ship , or maybe if it 's the middle of summer ; I 'd choose differently .
An OK hotel in a great location .
Would recommend this hotel .
The Hotel
Outstanding Hotel .
The Montecarlo is outstanding .
After taking the overnight train from Seville , we arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am .
To our surprise , we were able to get a room immediately .
The staff spoke excellent English and were extremely professional and helpful , immediately taking care of any request we had .
The location could n't be better , right on Las Ramblas .
The room was very spacious with a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub .
For a great light meal , breakfast or lunch , it was great to wander down to the large market and get beautiful large fresh strawberries and wonderful pastries from the vendors .
Loved it .
We stayed at the Jazz hotel for 3 nights at the start of October .
The staff were very friendly and all spoke excellent English .
We were staying with our 1 year old and they could n't have been more helpful .
We had a lovely big room , beautifully decorated .
The pool was a really lovely place to relax by at the end of the day .
The hotel is also excellently positioned just by the top of La Rambla .
We had a fantastic time and I would recommend it to anyone .
For a 5 star hotel where the official ranking does not go above 4 , must do bette .
we were pleasantly surpised by this hotel - for a relatively cheap package deal we were expecting a lot , lot worse .
Location was fantastic , rooftop bar and pool lovely ( albeit expensive ! ) .
Slightly annoying were the lifts that would n't take you up there at 11pm , despite the bar being open until 1 . 30am !
I agree with other reviewers though that turn - down service and cleaning of rooms was erratic .
Ca n't comment on the breakfast or the other facilities on the hotel as we did n't really make use of them .
A big problem was the beds . Although very comfortable indeed , two small beds pushed together does not a romantic holiday make .
A negative part of our trip .
I just looked up this hotel , suprised to still see it is # 3 in Barcelona .
I have been meaning to write a review on this hotel because of the fact that staying here made me dislike Barcelona ( hotels really can affect your overall view of a place , unfortunately ) .
I usually trust trip advisor , and I did when I booked this hotel .
The hotel rooms are nice , the roof deck / pool is great , and the hotel is beautiful .
It is also in a great location .
The problem with the hotel is the staff .
The staff on our initial 2 days there were horrible , unhelpful , and never smiled ( particularly the front desk staff ) .
On our final day there , after much complaining , we managed to find some helpful staff and wished they had been that nice the entire time .
A great hotel should never have mean , unfriendly , and unhelpful staff .
The best part of our trip was when we actually left the hotel and stayed elsewhere !
Amazing room , Bad service .
The room is AMAZING .
The view of the harbor , the ipod connected stereo system , the amazing shower , the comfy bed , the flatscreen tv , the electric window shades , etc , all means one word : SUPERCOOL .
Even the hotel location is okay , because the tourist bus ( the BEST way to get around the city ) has a stop just outside the hotel .
However , beware the service .
The concierge is soooooooo busy , especially at weekends that we found it quicker to call restaurants ourselves ( we even got better tables by calling ourselves ) .
One time , the concierge did not even call us back .
And when we asked for a US adapter for our laptop , it took 45 minutes and three calls to get it .
Not what you would expect for a place like this .
If they could improve the service , this would be a top hotel even on a world - level standard .
With the service as it is , it 's worth the money , but only just .
Nice but expensive , characterless and with some other problems .
I spent 5 nights in the Barcelona Universal .
I was initially very happy with the hotel , but did find myself becoming more disappointed each day , though overall I have to say it is acceptable .
Its a business hotel . Not very homely .
The room was large enough , with two single beds and room to literally stretch your legs on all sides ( should you care to do such a thing ) .
I was satisfied with the cleanliness of the room , and I 'm the kind of person who brings disinfectant wipes with me when I travel .
The facilities ; phones , net access , TV , minibar , AC , and safe were all modern .
The bathroom too was comfortable .
There is a free office facility on the 9th floor ( 2 PCs and printers ) which might prove handy to you .
The staff were fine , though I would n't describe them as especially friendly .
The area was I guess pretty good .
I was n't there to sightsee but I think the stuff you might want to see is fairly accessible on foot , plus there 's a metro station directly outside the door .
It is very noisy though .
The street its on is very busy and stays that way until quite late / early .
Also , an ambulance / police car blares past every 10 minutes - seriously .
Now this is not too much of a problem as the windows do insulate from sound very well , but you just ca n't leave them open , which means you 've got to run the AC all day .
Those of you with any kind of green conscience may feel a little bad about that .
Also , speaking of noise , running water in the neighbouring bathrooms can be heard quite clearly , though other than that internal noise is not a problem .
Now the room service was frankly very poor .
I did n't actually visit the restaurant , but the food I had sent up on several occasions would barely have been acceptable in a bar ( pub grub ) .
This is a four star hotel and they charge as such , so this was really quite unacceptable ( of course I did n't complain . . . wimp ) .
Breakfast was okay , but at E E13.50 , or there abouts , a go it would want to be . . . I thought it was included !
Its just as well that house keeping decided to stop giving me those things to hang on your door to say what you want !
Overall , I could go back ( on business that is , I would not go back on my own penny ) but I think I 'd rather try somewhere else if I had that kind of budget ( E150 per night ! ) .
Montecarlo , Barcelona - Decent hotel .
I have just returned from my vacation to Barcelona , Spain .
After thoroughly researching hotels in the area I decided to book with the Montecarlo , which based on reading other reviews , met my expectations .
The hotel lobby was very nice , the room was small but clean and we had a great view of las rambla from our balcony .
The location of the hotel was great since we were right in the center of the area , most of what we wanted to do and see was within walking distance .
Generally the front desk staff were very helpful with suggestions for where to eat and go out etc .
We never ate at the hotel since there were so many options so close by so I ca n't comment on the food there .
The only dissapointment with the hotel was the Internet access which was limited - I was never able to open or send any emails from my hotmail account .
Also remember to bring your own travel iron as the hotel does not have one .
Very dissappointing .
I had booked this room based on the glowing reviews from this site and I have to say I was very dissappointed .
I had booked our rooms directly with the hotel .
When we arrived they could n't find our reservation and the hotel was nearly full .
We eventually did get a room but not the room we had agreed to .
We did get a slight discount but again this was not what I had expected .
First of all the room we were in was very dated and needed some updating .
Not what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre .
The room also needed some cleaning .
I sensed this was a room that was used as a last resort and understandably so .
The noise level from La Rambla kept us up much of the night .
A very bad experience .
We requested another room but they could n't accomodate us so we went across the street to the Hotel 1898 for the remainder of our stay in Barcelona and the experience there was much better .
Shame about the work !
Floor plan - indication of room size
A grand disappointment .
We visited the hotel from June 11 - 14 , 2007 .
We were very disappointed with the quality of this hotel .
We booked it based upon the reviews on this site .
I expected a high quality boutique hotel and it turned out to be a high - priced ( 198 euros per night + tax ) , run down establishment .
The hallways were dimly lighted .
The hallways and room carpeting were stretched and stained .
The walls were banged up and we had a view of the adjoining buildings ' roof tops .
The furniture was old .
The bed was more like a cot with a pad on the top than a bed .
The location is great and the staff is friendly , but the facility is definitely not as advertised .
Although it tainted our first visit to Barcelona , we could not change hotels since there was a large convention in town and all of the better hotels were booked .
If you 're looking for a nice , clean hotel , this is not the one for you !
Nice enough hotel - Barcelona was very very disapointing .
The hotel reception staff were great , very welcoming and helpful and the rooms and the hotel are nice enough .
It did get very noisy in the rooms at night though as our room was situated facing a main road and ambulances went up and down all night every night making it hard to sleep .
The hotel bar was just a waste of space with no bar staff ever on it , no draught beers and they had even ran out of vodka when we asked so we could not sit and have a drink before bed .
As for Barcelona itself it was a massive let down and I really ca n't see what all the fuss is about .
It is overly expensive unless you stay off the main strip and you really need prior knowledge of the good spots to avoid being ripped of ( charged €28 for two poor breakfasts and another €28 for two large beers on las ramblas - go slightly off the strip however into a square and there are one or two great restaurants and pubs selling top food and drink for cheap )
It is very run down in places and from the hotel you have to walk down ' prostitute street ' to get to the main strip .
Also the main smell in and around las ramblas and most of where we went in Barcelona is of the sewers .
We have been to many places and barcelona is the one place we will be happy never to return too .
Great Hotel for Central Barcelona .
After trawling this site and others , we went for this hotel for a short weekend trip to Barcelona .
We went there on route to a friend 's wedding so I was looking for somewhere central that would give us access to all the main tourist spots .
The hotel is ideally located at the top of the Ramblas right opposite the beginning of the Gothic quarter .
I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly .
The room was small but really clean , contemporary in design .
We overlooked the middle courtyard which was great for us as it meant we were n't disturbed by the noise on the Ramblas .
The breakfast is fantastic if a little expensive ( you 're looking at around 拢15 for it ) .
So , either make sure you give youself plenty of time to graze or head out to one of the coffee bars in the area to grab a coffee pastry .
The highlight of the hotel really for me was the rooftop pool - very peaceful and relaxing after a day 's sightseeing .
I would definitely recommend this hotel as a very good mid range option .
Mmmmmm .
Staff were great , a bonus when you are travelling with a 3 year old .
Rooms were surprisingly dowdy and old fashioned given the fantastic lobby , bar , restaurant etc areas .
Maybe a tad on the overpriced side of things but we enjoyed it well enough .
Altho be warned that it is not very central for the attractions .
Excellent .
This hotel provided excellent service ! !
The hotel is an good location close to all the necesaff are say places you would like to visit within a walking distance .
The staff are great ! !
The hotel is slightly expensive but its in a 4 star hotel and its also in the centre of everything and to be honest its not anymore expensive than most places Barcelona .
Best hotel ever been too ! !
Gem of a Hotel in a terrific location .
The Harbor - Barcelona
Enjoyed our stay - Great Value .
We stayed at Hotel Jazz during the final leg of a 2.5 week trip to Spain and France .
We paid about 110 Euro for a standard room .
Based on previous posts we requested and got a higher floor room on the 6th floor .
The front desk was very accomodating given our unexpected late arrival due to a delayed flight from France .
One drawback was that they were unable to provide a luggage cart for our 6 bags , so we ended up taking two trips up and down to get everything into the room .
We heard very little street noise and definitely no impact from the rumbling of the metro that we read about .
We did hear quite a bit of noise from the hallway , but it was quiet at night .
Also , the curtains in the room are incredible .
They blocked almost all the light ! !
The room was very nice , we did have a king bed , which was actually two twins pushed together . I would rate this just ok .
The bed was adequate , we could sleep , but nothing to rave about .
We took advantage of the wireless Internet . It was very very easy to use and very helpful to us .
Also English speaking news stations were great , particularly CNBC Europe .
The bathroom was fantastic .
Fresh towels and toiletries every day , which was great .
Toiletries were great , razor kit ( husband forgot to pack a razor ) , toothbrush , sewing kit , shampoos , soaps , etc .
The rooftop pool is smaller , but wonderful .
A great way to start the day with relaxation or to unwind after a long day .
It was crowded sometimes , but we always managed to get a chair .
Also , the tables were great , we bought sandwiches a few days and just ate them up there , which was nice .
The hotel location is awesome , very centralized and easy to get just about anywhere in the city .
We had lunch one day at d ' Or across the street . It was great .
Also , I do n't speak Spanish at all and thrive on coffee , so was pleased to find a nearby Starbucks . . . . .
I know I know , but it was good for me .
The front desk was not good with recommendations for where to buy some bottled water , etc . but we found the Champions grocery on the rambla which was a great solution for water and wine to keep in the room .
They were very helpful though in making reservations at local restaurants we wanted to try and navigating the metro .
They also gave some interesting recommendations for walks around the city that were not on the map .
I definitely recommend going to dinner one night at La Venta in the Tibidabo area of the city .
We ate upstairs , where you will need reservations , but the service , food , and view were outstanding ! !
Most horrible of vacation !
After reading other reviews , we selected the Pulitzer using Booking . com .
We booked a double with breakfast for one night .
On arrival , we were taken to the smallest room in the whole hotel which we were assured would be quiet .
This room could never have been intended for 2 people of any persuasion .
We literally had to move the chair in order to get to the doorway .
We were told there were no other rooms available .
The disaster was later .
The air / heat did not function .
It was cold outside , but HOT in this room .
We could not open the window , due to the noise outside from Playa Catalunya , even though we were told this room was quiet .
With the window closed , the parties went on until about 4:00 am and this was a Wednesday night .
The dry hot evening was unbearable .
The breakfast included was just OK .
Conditions in the hotel are not good .
Paint was gashed all over the place and it generally did not appear to be clean .
The staff were pleasant .
We would not book again in any season !
A great place .
We recently stayed at the hotel and on the whole it was great .
The rooms were comfortable and modern .
The pool area is located on the roof and gives a fantastic view of the city .
The only problem was the lack of sun loungers .
It is only a small area and a little cramped , Although the beach is located just 10 minutes walk from the hotel .
There are many bars and restaurants nearby and the port is only a short walk away .
It was very busy here and the night life was excellent .
Every taste is catered for .
A lovely market was also here .
We did not see any street crime during our stay in the city but we were warned a couple of times about leaving our bags on the table .
Barcelona is a beautiful place with plenty of culture .
The best for me was visiting the architecture of Gaudi .
The Sagrada Familia is breath taking but amazingly no where near finished after 120 years since it was started .
My personel favorite was Gaudis Casa Mila built in 1906 .
It was a residential apartment block and one of the apartments is preserved .
If you like Art Nouveau this is the place for you .
A huge disappointment - very poor value .
My wife and I recently stayed for thee nights at the Hotel Majestic - what a misnomer !
We booked through Lastminute ( efficient ) and paid approximately 1 , 000 Euros for the three nights ( breakfast not included - see below ) for a superior room .
The location , on the Paseo de Gracia , is superb , especially as we were doing the tourist bit - it is close to many sites , and to the metro and the Barcelona tour bus stops .
After that , with the notable exception of the front - desk staff , who were extremely helpful , everything was downhill . . . . . . . . . .
The problems centred around the room itself , and the ( in ) competency of the staff and their ( poor ) attitude .
I do n't think we 've ever paid so much for such a small , poorly equipped room .
We had requested a King bed - we got two singles pushed together .
The windows are tiny , and the bathroom not much bigger .
Room cleaning was perfunctory at best .
However , the biggest issue with the room was ( lack of ) air - conditioning .
During our stay in Barcelona , it was relatively warm , exacerbated by the heating in the room being on full when we arrived .
We turned this off but , during the whole of our stay , we could never get the room cool enough to sleep in comfortably .
When we complained , we were told that the air - conditioning was turned off in the winter in favour of heating , and nothing could be done ( remember , this is a 5* hotel ) .
Opening the window was no good - not only was it too small to make much difference , the hotel 's location meant that there was always traffic noise .
We could just about have lived with the room , had the service been great . . .
Four examples - - on our first night , we had booked a restaurant outside the hotel .
We asked the concierge to hail us a taxi , which he did .
We inadvertently forgot to tip him so , on our return , my wife specifically sought him out and did tip him , with apologies .
Yet the next three times we asked the concierge staff to hail a taxi , they clearly and deliberately ignored us , such that we had to do it ourselves , - the bar staff in the main bar on the ground floor seemed obsessed by tips .
Having had poor service the first night ( waiting 25 minutes for a simple order of drinks ) , we did not tip the waiter - on succeeding nights , we simply could not get the waiters to pay any attention to us - as I said earlier , breakfast is not included .
We tried the breakfast buffet in the basement ( no windows ) .
Everything about breakfast was chaotic and disorganised - it took several minues to get seated , and then an eternity to get the tea we had ordered which , when it arrived , was lukewarm .
Hoping for better things with room service the next day , we were sorely disappointed - wrong order , food that was barely warm , and this time the tea was almost cold ! !
At over 20 euros , the cost for waht you get is exorbitant . - last straw - on departure , we had an early morning flight to catch at Barcelona airport , travelling through the rush hour .
Fifteen minutes after requesting a porter , no - one had appeared , so I called again - a further ten minutes elapsed with no show .
My wife and I gathered up our luggage , and headed downstairs .
When we hit the lobby , I 'm sure you can guess by now what happened . . . . . three porters , no less , wishing to help us to a taxi , and earn the magic tip - we declined despite their evident disapproval .
My summary - despite its wonderful location , the facilities of this hotel represent vary poor value for money ( suggest you try the Hotel des Arts ) - by no stretch of the imagination do they equate to five star .
This is exacerbated by the approach and attitude of the staff - with the notable exception of the front desk , they seem driven by one motive - a tip .
I could and would not recommend this hotel to anyone .

Major 5 Star Hotel that just does n't hit the mark .
This is a nice , 5 - star hotel in Barcelona that tries very hard but just does n't quite hit the mark .
My friend and I checked into the hotel at two separate times and had two different check - in experiences . Mine was friendly and helpful and even a glass of champagne .
His was awkward , his room was n't ready , no champagne offered and he was getting a suite while I just reserved a regular room .
The hotel is large ( 44 stories ) and modern with great views of the city of Barcelona and / or the Mediterranean Sea .
The rooms are fairly large , modern and comfortable .
The staff was fairly helpful although when my friend arrived by taxi he was not offered help with his two large bags and had to take them to his room by himself .
We were both bothered by the housekeeping staff on more than one occassion when we had the do not disturb sign out .
Its a great hotel but just does n't quite live up to the five star reputation it has especially for the price of rooms .
Wonderful Start .
After spending around 20 straight hours on airplanes and in airports , my wife and I arrived at the Montecarlo at 11PM , for the start of a long awaited and eagerly anticipated Spain vacation .
I was thinking nap time , but as anyone who has been to Barcelona knows , the city is just waking up about then .
So we threw some cold water on our faces and out into the night we went .
Barcelona is an exciting and fun city .
The Hotel Montecarlo is perfectly situated on Ramblas , a short walk to many fine restaurants and cafes , along with open air markets and museums .
For longer jaunts , we took public transportation .
Being an urban planner , I truly appreciated Barcelona 's splendid combination of art , design , form and function .
At no time did I ever feel lost or unsafe ( using some common sense , of course ) .
The Hotel Montecarlo was the perfect compliment to our Barcelona experience .
The room , overlooking the Ramblas was spacious and modern with a classy shower / jacuzzi tub .
The staff was very accommodating and helpful .
In particular , we left our passports in our room 's safe when we left for Girona .
Marina , the front desk staff person , was very helpful and made sure that we received them without incident a few days later .
Marina also was extremely helpful regarding local sites , customs and eateries .
It was the perfect start to a wonderful vacation .
Without a doubt , we would return to the Hotel Montecarlo .
Good hotel but overpriced .
My husband and I stayed at the Jazz for 7 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary so we booked a suite .
I knew the cost when I booked ( direct with the hotel for suites unfortunately ) but for that sum I expected separate living / sleeping rooms , however the suites are just large bedrooms with a bed settee and small table / chairs added .
As a previous reviewer has said the beds are queen size but hard , although we did get used to them and slept well .
Although the room and bathroom ( 506 ) were modern , clean and reasonably sized it was not what I had expected for 267 Euros a night for room only .
I asked a receptionist if I could have bathrobes but she said that as they were only a 3 star hotel they did n't provide them - 3 star maybe but 4 star prices ! !
We did n't have breakfast in the hotel as I thought they were receiving enough of our money so I ca n't comment on the food .
We did go into the bar on the 1st floor around 11 .
30pm one night but it was completely empty with no atmosphere , in spite of the hotel apparently being full .
The pool was also being repaired throughout our stay so we not in use .
On the positive side the hotel is well situated and the maid service is excellent .
Soundproofing is also very effective and we always found the reception staff pleasant .
Three restaurants we particularly enjoyed during our stay were : CAPUTXES - opposite the large church in the old town ( not the cathedral - ca n't remember it 's name but Del Mar rings a bell ) . It 's an Italian restaurant and the lunches are really good value and excellent quality .
Service is very good too .
AGUA - near Port Olympic in the row of restaurants alongside the beach .
Need to book for dinner as it 's very popular but lunch is good too . A bit more expensive but worth the extra cost .
Le Nits ( not its full name but all I remember .
It 's in Placa Real , off Las Ramblas and queuing starts before 8pm - it opens at 8 . 30 - no booking .
This place is fabulous , great extensive menu wine list - Not to be missed !
Nice Hotel for European Standards , but with Problems .
This hotel was very nice .
The room we received was very large even for American standards and two walls were windows so we had a great view .
The bathroom was sizable as well .
There was a bathroom with lots of amenities and separate shower .
There were large closets , two tables , two chairs , large TV , and even a radio .
The only problem was that when I had switched on a light , the circuit blew and we ended up sitting in the dark , along with our next door neighbors .
The hotel staff came in and tried to fix the lights , but they could not .
They gave us another room .
That room was equally large .
However , the bathroom wreaked of sewage . It was disgusting .
The room also faced Sants Station , which was another negative .
After going through the fiasco of packing up and moving late at night to the 2nd room , we found that the construction was still going on and would keep us up , if the smell of the bathroom did not .
We went back down and asked for another room . This time , we got a smaller one , but at least the bathroom did not smell and we were n't facing the construction .
However , by the time we went to bed , it was quite late .
All in all , even though we had to go through this fiasco of changing rooms , the staff was accommodating .
The location of the hotel was convenient .
Sants Station was just around the corner and you could get anywhere form there .
The train from the airport went straight here as well .
There was a supermarket next door to obtain any necessities or food that was desired .
It was convenient overall .
Do n't Give This Hotel a Second Look .
Hotel is not what you expect for a 4 star hotel .
If you stay in other 4 star hotels in the UK , America , or other places in Europe , I would expect certain items as Tea / Coffee in your room .
The only freebie you got was internet access and a safe We arrived as a party of 8 on Monday 17th September , and left on Saturday 22nd September .
On arrival hotel looked OK but the area is very run down , dirty and very noisy .
Yes I agree with others that it 's location is great for Las Rambla and the Metro , but I guarantee there are better hotels in a more suitable area than this one .
The room I stayed in was fine , ca n't complain too much about it , but 2 of our 3 other rooms had hardly any / no view ( except a brick wall ) , again not great considering the amount of money you spend for a 4 star hotel room
On Tuesday night , the toilet continually dripped water into the toilet bowl , told reception the next morning and they said it would be dealt with .
Great I thought .
Was out until early evening , came back to room and the room was left open . Totally amazed , so much for security .
Luckily nothing was taken , informed reception and they were very apologetic .
We got a bottle of Champagne on the house , but only because I asked for something from the hotel .
The worst was yet to come though .
In our party we had 2 special birthdays , 40 and 16 .
We decided to stay in the hotel for a celebratory evening meal on the Friday - the night before we left .
What a mistake ! ! !
The service was dire , food average , the chips were cold .
When the champagne was delivered , it was not put into an ice bucket , and not even poured by the waitress / waiters .
This I hope does not sound snobby in any form , as you get this sort of service in standard restaurants .
I asked for the air conditioning to be switched on and the smell from it was vile . It smelt like urine , and these fumes were blowing onto the salad buffet bar .
My clothes , by the end of the night , smelt very badly , imagine what the food was like .
As it was 2 birthday celebrations , we got the hotel to bring out a cake with some candles .
They did so , we then asked for a knife to cut the cake .
A butcher 's carving knife was brought out , and only when I was about to cut the cake , it was noticed , by one of our party , that the knife had blood all over it . It was absolutely disgusting , I could not believe my eyes .
Reception was immediately informed , and again were very apologetic , kept the knife for evidence to inform the hotel manager the next morning .
We were given some extra champagne as a sorry , along with a large apple pie .
After seeing what their utensils look like , did they think we would eat it ?
To make matters worse , when I returned to my room , I met 2 other guests who had eaten out and had had a great meal .
I told them about the night 's events , and they were told by the man on reception not to eat at the hotel and to definitely eat out - says it all does n't it ?
So the following morning , I expected to see the hotel manager , but he was not due in , even though I was told he was going to be .
Instead we saw the duty manager , who again was very apologetic .
We did not pay for the meal , our drinks or any of the champagne .
I asked the hotel to write to me via e-mail but nothing is yet to arrive .
I will be sending this report direct to the hotel as I thought I at least deserved a response from the hotel , but then again , do they care ?
Would I go back ? ? Most definitely not .
Would I recommend it , again most definitely not .
If you want to eat food that is been cut with cross contaminated utensils , then go to this hotel .
But if their own staff state not to eat their food , then trust me - Do n't get me wrong , the room was very clean , most of the staff were helpful , especially Veronica , but certain members were very snooty and were quite unhelpful .
So , not a great review for the hotel , I agree , but I believe in honesty .
Be very aware and careful where you go
Not the service we expected .
Having read all the reviews I do not believe this Hotel lives up to its reputation - we had a few problems with service , no - one seems to answer the phones and worse still staff , when confronted with problems give the impression they do not care .
Will definitely NOT return .
Fab location yet still quiet indoors .
Stayed with my partner for 3 nights at the Royal Ramblas Hotel in Barcelona .
The hotel was easy to find and one of the best locations .
Room was large and bright and thankfully the aircon worked as it was very hot outside .
No noise at all from the street .
One small niggle was the low water pressure in the shower but overall , a great hotel which allowed us a late checkout for a small surcharge .
We did not eat in the hotel so can not comment on the food .
does n't deserve 3rd place .
Hotel Jazz has a great location to Las Ramblas and Bus Touristica .
The rooms were good sized , perfectly cleaned , and with very nice toiletries .
There was a very nice and empty lounge on the 1st floor with free internet service with two computer stations .
I thought the beds were hard but comfortable .
We were a large group and had one double ( 2 twins together ) and one junior suite with one double and a queen sofa sleeper .
The children were disappointed that the pool was closed , but it is never heated anyway .
The maid service was the best !
Better than any luxury hotel I have ever stayed at . the Consthe front staff needs to learn how to give directions , provide suggestions for restaraunts and entertainment , and be nice .
If you have been to Barcelona and know how to get around - this is a great hotel .
If you are new to the area , I would not recommend it .
It is hard to find , taxi drivers never know how to find it and if they make a booking for you - they probably receive an incentive .
On one incident , i made my own booking , I believe the staff was not happy , so he sent me to the wrong address .
I plan to visit barcelona often so right now I have nothing to compare it with .
But thereare many choices to choose from .
Modern hotel . . . pretty comfortable .
This is a very modern and comfortable hotel with great access to public transport and airport transport .
The staff is very friendly , spoke english very well , and seemed pretty helpful .
My room was a King size bed , with a private bathroom , closet , safe , and fantastic air conditioning .
The lighting situation was a little tricky in that you needed to use a room key to turn the lights on by sticking it in a slot by the inside of the door .
That information would have been helpful had the front desk told me that right away , but after a quick trip down , they told me what to do .
No harm . . . no foul .
There is a very nice business center on the 9th floor where you can do your flight check ins , but there was no printer that I saw .
The only drawback to staying at this hotel is while the location is right by the Metro , it 's sort of far from lots of the attractions .
Taking the metro is a must during the nighttime hours as this is not the safest city by any means .
I do not recommend walking from Las Ramblas at night , unless you enjoy being propositioned multiple times by underage prostitutes or getting your passport stolen and robbed of your wallet .
Both of which I saw happening firsthand .
This has nothing to do with the hotel , it 's the city in general .
Not so safe .
Once inside the hotel , all seemed safe .
Great Location and a great hotel .
We stayed at the Montecarlo in October 2007 .
We were very pleased with the hotel .
It has been redecorated in a modern theme which we liked and has some nice touches such as adjustable beds , robes and slippers , and electic rollup blalckout shades .
The location is super , Even though it is on the La Rambla , it is very quiet and we were never bothered by street noise .
The desk staff was most knowledgeable and quite helpful .
We did not opt for the breakfast as it was not included in the price of the room .
There a several places close by that are cheaper .
I do n't think you can beat this hotel for its location and price and for what you get for your money .
We would definitely stay there again .
Spend your hard earned money elsewhere .
Spend your hard earned money elsewhere .
I 'm amazed that they continue to think Hotel Majectic is a 5* when they do n't have a clue how to execute like one .
Having us wait for our room for 1 1 / 2 hours way past the check - in time was not fair .
After all , we paid their upscale rate and just want better treatment and service .
2 twin beds put side by side does n't make it a king size bed and is most uncomfortable .
Please refrain from using your renovation as an excuse for doing such a lousy job and consider lowering your rating for what it 's worth , 2* maybe 3 and nothing more .
Style and luxury on the Ramblas .
I have just come back from 4 nights at the 1898 .
I relied on the comments and ratings from Tripadvisor and they were spot on : The superior room is easily big enough for all but ( possibly ? ) the North American market , which does after all like things really BIG .
The hotel bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on .
Normally I long to be back in my own bed , but this one was just perfectly comfortable - not too hard and not too soft .
Very dark curtains means you can sleep all morning and not realise it ! ( yes , I did . . . )
Dimming room lighting : bit of a gimmick , but very nice touch once you get used to it .
Linen was crisp and heavy cotton , and changed daily .
Towels were changed twice daily ( dont go here if you are an eco - warrior ! )
Shower and bath taps : I noted the comments on TA : its really not rocket science - there is one dial for temperature , one for shower / bath tap , and one for small shower head on sep pipe .
There is no need for further instructions , IMHO Noise : had a room overlooking ramblas ( room 444 ) .
Could hear some noise through double glazing ( occasional police siren , some traffic ) but never enough to disturb or prevent sleep .
Benefits of overlooking ramblas outweigh noise problem .
If you 're a VERY light sleeper , go for internal room .
Spa and pools : superb .
Dark cellar pool was atmospheric , roof terrace pool superb location with view of city .
Roof terrace probably comes into its own in the summer months , though . . .
Location : can not be beaten .
Decor : stylish , modern , bit on the dark side , but it all works well together .
Staff : Faultless . made restaurant reservation , confirmed my existing reservation , left note in my room to say they had done it . always courteous and polite , multi - lingual .
Top tip : no need to get concierge to arrange a taxi - they ring for one and by the time it arrives , it already has several euros on the clock .
Just walk 5 yards onto Ramblas and hail one - never took me longer than 30 seconds .
An unplesant stay .
My girlfriend and I stay in this hotel after returning from a 12 days cruise and were truly disappointed .
I had booked this hotel because it was Trip Advisor 's 2006 Top Pick .
Although I had contacted the general manager and asked for an early check in , we waited until about 1:00 before we were able to check in .
We found the lobby to be very shabby and when finally showed to our room there was construction on our floor ( which was never disclosed when I contacted the general manager about early check in )
The room was especially small , the beds ( twins ) were pushed up against the window , what I thought was a balcony room ended up overlooking the top of other buildings and the room was really narrow which I understand is typical of European hotel rooms but this was beyond small .
The bathroom was so narrow that you could n't fit two people in it , although that would have been difficult since there was only one sink which kept clogging up .
The resturant was not open for dinner and did n't open until 2:00 for lunch , so we were forced to find something else .
Although the staff was helpful there seemed to be a lot of confusion when we asked for help .
I confirmed out flight for the next day , but found out later , after we arrived at the airport four hours early , that the reservation had changed .
We stayed in another hotel the first night we arrived in Barcelona and that was a wonderful experience and were disappointed that this was the way we ended our trip .
The most laughable thing was that they allowed one kleenex for two people in a little sample box marked for women , guess the men do n't need kleenex .
The lights were difficult to figure out , the noise level up to about 6:00 pm was really loud .
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone .
It was truly a disappointment .
Excellent Hotel .
Before we stayed here , I read all the reviews posted and decided that the best bet was to ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid the noise form underground trains .
When we arrived we were given a room on the 7th floor anyway so no need to ask .
Sitting in the bar on 2nd floor the noise from the trains was evident , but not overpowering .
Ask for a room on a higher floor but do n't worry if you do n't get it .
Other reviews mentioned the street noise , as far as I could see all the rooms had windows that opened into a central courtyard .
With the window open you can hear the street noise even on the 7th floor .
However close the window and it was completely silent .
All rooms have Air con so there is no need to have the window open .
Right thats the practicalities out of the way .
The hotel it 's self was very central and really well presented .
The style is contemporary but not minimalist .
The beds were huge and very comfortable .
I have stayed in many mid range hotels in cities , and for the rate this has to be the best .
Do yourself a favour and stop looking for a hotel in Barcelona , you have just found it ! ! ! !
dissapointed with expensive nice hotel , .
I just returned from barcelona spain , vienna , prague , budapest and munich germany , Barcelona , spain , - do not stay at the clarion pulitzer near las ramblas , I arrived in the evening , they took my credit card , passport information , and I had requested a restaurant for me and my kids to go out to eat at .
we went out , came back , and the next morning when i wanted to ck out .
there was a dinner charge from the hotel on my bill , the only way , from that evening until the next morning to get a charge on my bill was from the staff using my information and trying to sign the dinner charge with my name . to my room .
In other words make sure you ck your bill before leaving the hotel .
they have some scam going on .
Las ramblas is not a safe area , either are the subways , the so called gypsies are causing distractions so others can pickpocket you , i witness it on the subway with an accordian player .
they work in teams .
I saw wallets getting passed and within seconds the person was off the subway .
be careful .
the food in barcelona was not the best either unless you like shrimp w / the heads on them or at fancy restaurants .
the hoof and leg of the animal clamped in a device in the middle of the dining room , it was not very appealing to me .
On the positive side , there is alot to do there , the on / off sightseeing bus was wonderful , sagradia familiar is best to see 1st thing in the morning , climbing up all the stairs , is definitly tiring on the legs , they shook for 5 minutes after i came down .
the view is amazing up there , yes and there is a elevator with a long wait .
anyways , glad to be back in the usa ! ! !
Loved the Jazz .
Ca n't beat the Hotel Jazz for location !
Just a few minutes walk to almost anywhere you want to be .
The rooms are very clean and comfortable - shockingly quiet given activity on the streets below .
Like others mentioned , I would have liked a shower curtain to keep the water contained but not that big of an issue .
Only issue we had was temp of the room : It was pretty warm and we could n't get the air to kick in . . . meant we had to open the balcony door and hear all of the noise below . . .
Small consequence for great place !
Stay here soon ! !
Stay here when you come to Barca .
It is the best hotel for a comfortable friendly and clean experience .
Staff are fantastic , very welcoming and friendly , speak excellent English if your Catalan or Spanish isnt up to scratch !
Pool is great for a midday break between trips around the city , with great views and lots of sun chairs , plus tables to have drinks .
Breakfast is a bit pricey but worth it once in a while when your feeling lazy in the morning .
Our room was very nice , comfortable , modern without being cold , nice bathroom , great shower which I consider essential , air conditioning , great safe which unusually the hotel will accept liability for if something is stolen ( up to 600 euro worth ) .
Central location without being too noisy at night , you can hear the metro rumble occassionally , but this never affected me , I only ever noticed when I was awake .
Also its very reasonable !
Nice Decor , Nice Staff , Good Location .
The 1898 Hotel is in a good location , the decor is very pleasant and the atmosphere quiet and peaceful .
However our stay was marred by the rooms being too hot .
Strangely , rooms have lots of flashy controls for individualising sound and lighting but have none for temperature and have no air conditioning unit .
We were sweating buckets and this is in March !
So goodness help anyone staying there in August !
We had no option but to open our windows which then brought in lots of noise .
Our other bug bear was that this is one of those hotels which seems to think that twin beds pushed together somehow constitutes a double room .
Very disappointing for a romantic break !
Not Good .
I was very much looking forward to my stay at the ' five star ' Hotel Majestic but from the minute I arrived I was underwhelmed .
I booked directly with the hotel and paid extra for a room with a balcony .
The room itself was fine , nothing special but fine , however when I went out on the balcony I was extremely disappointed . Not only was it shabby and a little bit grubby looking but there were these awful large bolts and screws exposed all along the wall , which not only looked unsightly but could also have easily caused a nasty scrape .
We informed reception who came and had a look at the exposed bolts but did n't actually offer to do anything about them .
The hotel 's roof top terrace is tiny and only has about 7 or 8 sun loungers so unless you are up there first thing in the morning you can forget about it .
The final straw came when I requested an additional sun lounger for our private balcony ( as there was only one on it ) .
The girl at reception reluctantly agreed to check ' if it was possible ' and said she would call me back to let me know .
I sat waiting for 30 mins with no repsonse .
At this stage I had had enough .
So we packed our bags , checked out and went to another hotel .
When we were checking out they did apologise and offered to upgrade us to a suite but by that stage I just wanted to get out of there .
However they did charge us for the one night we stayed .
It is possible that we were just unlucky with the room we were given but overall I expect alot more from a 5 star standard hotel .
The atmosphere in the hotel is pretty stade and the staff are not the friendliest .
I would n't recommend this hotel .
just ok and expensive .
stayed for long weekend , hotel just ok , not good , not bad .
staff very good and nothing is to much trouble . but very expensive to have a drink and unwind here , decore ok , very modern if that is what you like .
breakfast very good but be down early or not much left .
location is the best thing about hotel and dont be fooled by picture of swiming pool , it is just the size of a large bath .
but overhaul not bad
Wonderful Hotel with great service .
I can not believe the bad reviews given to this hotel by some reviewers .
We stayed Sept 21 - 23 , 2004 and had absolutely excellent service .
We were greeted with complimentary Cava and chocolates for our anniversary .
The rooms were huge and comfortable , with many amenities .
We had turn - down service both nights we were there , and the breakfast buffet was excellent , even though we arrived at the end of the scheduled time .
I suggest you try this place for yourself , and I believe you will be more than satisfied .
It is right on the bus route , or 1 and 1 / 2 blocks away from the bottom of Las Ramblas - - a pleasant distance to be sure .
We would definately stay here again !
Do not accept to move to Expo Hotel ! ! !
Well . . . I should start by the booking process . . .
Booked a night through a last minute website .
Booking was confirmed at the hotel .
Surprise arriving at the Hotel . .
As many other messages , hotel claims that Torre Catalunya is overbooked and we should move to sister Hotel next door , EXPO HOTEL .
Simply have a look on the review of Expo Hotel ( which I did before coming ) and see the difference .
I said to the recepcionist that this was not negotiable , that I had a booking there , and would stay there .
She went 3 times to see the manager , and at the end . . Magic . . A room appear to me and my 5 years old son .
Not a room . . a choice of smoking , no smoking , doubles , twins . . etc . .
I am a Hotel owner , and the strategy is simple .
Sell the Hotel Torre with inviting promotions and last minute prices , and place guests at the next door hotel .
Their ratings are bad , so people will be more tempted to try Torre .
Once guests arrive at the reception , they try to put you next door .
The Torre hotel is nice , modern and trendy .
Although some lack of details on the room .
The amenities choice are the poorest I have seen in a hotel 4* .
On the bathroom , there is a telephone , which is chic and nice .
But what is the point having a phone where the phone cable measures 25 feet . . .
Yes , that amount of cable hanging beside the bowl and the bidet ! ! !
And 2 wholes on the middle of the marble on the shower area . . We were on the 3rd floor . . .
facing the station . . . noisy . . . very noisy . .
So bad sound proofing there . .
Views of breakfast are breathtaking , but the buffet choice is not from a 4* . . . .
Again , it is nice , but not for the hotel classification .
I pai a promotional price of 150 euros for the night . . . .
Normal price would be 200 euros . . . To be honest . . . expensive . . Above all . . .
DO NOT ACCEPT GOING NEXT DOOR  .
FIRST : BAD RATINGS
SECOND : NOT SAME QUALITY
THIRD : SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME PRICE
FOUR : IT IS AN ATTEMP TO FOOL PEOPLE
Hotel without charm .
Great location - but that 's all
Noisy but Gem of a Hotel with rumblings of the Metro below .
We booked this hotel for the location and modern amentities , and the great reviews of other [ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ] traveler prior to July 17 .
Everything met our expectations except for the noise level .
We were on the the third floor and hear and felt the room shake whenever a Metro train pulled into the station in the underground below .
Coming from California , I sense when there 's an earthquake and this is what it felt like .
After the first night , we asked if it might make a difference if we moved to an upper floor , and the front desk said they would try but the hotel was fully booked .
Not sure it would have made a difference .
The front staff assured us the Metro ran until 12 midnight , but I was kept up until 1:30 am , and woken up at 5 am again when trains started running again .
Needless to say , I slept very badly on the both nights despite a full day of exploring the City .
Do n't know why the structure of the building did not insulated itself against the underground - - I have lived in NYC with many subways below my office or apt .
The hotel itself is luxurious and rooms comfy for the 150 euros we paid , but not worth the annoyance of hearing the trains .
Not sure why none of the other reviews we saw on traveladvisor . com did not mention the Metro noise .
Was everyone else on a higher floor than us on the 3rd ?
Other travel tips : Sagrada Familia : take the elevator with the shorter line , to the right of the entrance ( easy to miss this one bec you get swept into the church with the rest of the crowds to the opposite elevator ) .
Go between 6 and 7pm when the crowds have thinned .
Palau de Musica Catalan : indoor architectural tour of the stunning concert hall .
Great cafe with pintxos , brushetta - like snacks with all sorts of toppings .
Eating : Cafe L ' Opera , La Rambla : where Picasso had his coffee : - ) Churros con xocolata is the highlight .
Cal Pep , Placa de las Olles : tapas bar where the line starts before doors open at 8pm , no menu , waiter orders for you but you may tell him to stop serving or your bill will surprise you .
Origen , Passiage de Born : real Catalan homestyle cooking , magazine like menu with 5 pages of desserts before all other menu items !
Extremely reasonable - 35 euros for two .
**Overall , stay in the Gothic neighborhood to eat , restaurants are less touristic than La Rambla .
Catalans are friendly people , we did not encounter any rude locals at all .
location , location , location .
To be right in the heart of the action , you could n't find a better bet .
It was so easy to get anywhere - the tourist busses are close by , amazing ( but touristy ) restaurants , great shopping .
HOWEVER . . . this is a noisy , bustling hotel .
Do not stay in an interior courtyard room on a weekend - as all the windows face each other , and you can hear people partying ( or whatever ) until 3 or 4 in the morning .
Also , the beds are like rocks ( as most European hotels are ) so be prepared to see your chiropractor !
nice accomodations but not nice policies .
Grand Marina was a nice hotel , very modern and European in design and good location .
The location was on the water , a short walk from La Rambla . Very quiet .
However , had a problem on checkin .
I had booked a room with 2 twin beds for myself and 2 children .
On checkin they insisted that I upgrade to a more expensive room and pay extra for another bed even after I insisted that we did n't need 3 beds .
They said it was their ' politics ' and I didnt have any choice .
This cost me an additional 100 Euros per night !
Then the concierge was very demeaning and condescending to my children , kept saying they would hate everything there was to do , I must spend 12 days in Barcelona , why would I want to go to Montseratt ? ? ?
How absurd and then made sure to point out all the Mcdonalds on the map for the entire time , even after I told him I would not be going to McDonalds .
On top of that , he told me I would be mugged or pickpocketed if I took a purse with my anywhere in the city .
Needless to say , my children were very put off with Spain within the first hour .
I must say that the trip was fine after that despite the first few hours .
Other than that , I liked the location and the rooms were very modern and clean .
Minimalist efficiency but no charm .
Stayed for 2 nights to attend a conference in the hotel .
The position is not great given that it is by the water as it is a long walk to the main areas of interest .
A large modern hotel with no charm whatsoever .
Efficient staff and restaurant good .
Room was not large but acceptable .
Bathroom clean but bath plug broken .
Otherwise all OK and lots of hot water .
My room on 2nd floor was quite noisy .
Glazing did n't seem to cut out the noise from the outside .
Fine for a business stay but not really ideal for tourists .
It has no local charm and could be anywhere in the world .
It is expensive and there are other better placed hotels giving better value .
modern but lacking character .
my partner and i have visited barcelona several times and to our dismay found ourselves in a very modern hotel , very clean , staff friendly , but lacking any atmosphere . very buisness like with a mixture of suits and students .
the pool was very small and along with the very small bar seating area we spent most of our time wandering around barcelona which was a shame because we were actually looking for a relaxing lie around as in the the past we have never had a hotel in barcelona with a pool .
many couples at night when returning to the hotel went to there rooms for a half an hour and then returned to the bar area when seats were available .
i can not complain as such about this hotel but it states roof pool and i can only say if there were more than 4 people in the pool at once you may have bodily contact with strangers .
but i suppose there might be a seat spare in the bar for a beverage .
Nice Hotel . . . not a 5 Star one though ! !
Having stayed at this hotel last July for a friend 's hen weekend I knew it was a lovely hotel and for a 5* , good value , especially with the location .
I re - booked it for this May for a friend 's 30th and was disapointed that the prices had gone up by over 50 each PER NIGHT despite only being early May but felt it was worth it as we had used the facilities last year and it was superb .
However , we were extremely disapointed to discover that the swimming pool was empty and were told this was because it was n't summer yet despite the temperatures being 29 degrees ? ? ? ? ! ! ! !
Also , the rooms were not as good as they were the previous years and I just felt that overall , this was not acceptable for a far from cheap 5* hotel .
I wo n't be staying there again which is a real shame .
Do n't stay here if you do n't Know Spanish ! ! !
I booked this hotel on a tip from family members that this hotel is very good 5star hotel in Barcelona , But as i discovered this hotel must be a 3 star hotel ! ! ! !
If you want only a location then this hotel is your best bet in Barcelona for a shopping and walking around location , it 's in the middle of all the main shops and restaurants . . . .
That 's All . . . .
The rest are all Negatives . . . .
The only people who speak english in this hotel are the front desk staff and whoever in the ground floor . . . .
when you go to the room you feel you are lost because no one speaks or understands english when you call Room Service , House Keeping or any service they have ! ! ! !
I had to contact the front desk every time i wanted to order something or ask about something ! ! !
The Suite i stayed in had good size , but the furniture is Old Old , the TV has digital spanish channels but if you want to watch the other languages channels you have to use the analoge channels which are either inturrepted often or not as clear sometimes . . . . .
Concierge , NON existant at this hotel ! ! !
your best bets is to try and hope that 1 of the front desk staff is not busy . . . . .
the hotel needs a major renovation for the entire hotel rooms plus an English Course for all the Staff . . . .
Uneven service , loud housekeeping , but a nice property .
We had a three - night stay here from June 19 for our wedding honeymoon .
Our superior room had a nice large patio , but the room itself was small ( more like the classic rooms from the picture ) .
Noise was an issue - - not because of Las Ramblas , but because the chattering housekeepers would laugh up a storm in the hallways early every morning ( before 9 AM ) .
More generally , service was uneven : sometimes friendly , sometimes surly .
( 1 ) Doorman did not help us with our bags upon depature , even after seeing us carrying them .
( 2 ) Doorman told us a cab would take 10 minutes , even though walking one building over enabled us to get one ourselves in 1 minute .
( 3 ) Housekeepers were extremely noisy in the hallways as mentioned above .
( 4 ) Spa / gym attendant required us to put plastic booties over clean sneaker in order to view the gym , so as not to scuff the floors ( which makes no sense in a gym ) .
For 350 Euro / night , guests deserve better service .
Great Hotel - Service could Improve .
I recently spent a wonderful weekend in Barcelona staying at the Hotel 1898 .
The hotel is superb - set in a great location and the rooftop pool is awesome .
I reserved a classic room as when I called to enquire I was told that the Classic rooms which sit on the inner courtyard were all exactly the same size as rooms in the next category up , so I booked one of these thinking we would n't spend a great deal of time in the room anyway .
However when I was shown to my room ( room 510 ) after waiting 20 minutes , it was small , dark and awkwardly shaped , and looked nothing like the images on their website .
A bed was pushed up against the tiny window making the room even darker .
I checked the floorplan on the door and this room was indeed smaller than the other internal rooms as it was on the corner by the lifts , so I called reception to change the room .
As no other Classic rooms were available I had to pay an extra 50 euros per night for the privilege but the Superior room ( room 635 ) I now had was terrific - light , bright and airy with a street view .
The hotel 1898 have no dedicated concierge - and I was told that all the reception staff could assist with any query , but when I asked them to recommend a restaurant for dinner I was sent to an overpriced tourist trap on the beach with terrible food and awful service .
This was n't helped by the inaccurate directions they provided .
Taxis also seem to be quite difficult for them to organise ( perhaps due to the location ) , but we were always kept waiting ages or were advised to walk .
If you 're looking for a great - and cheap - seafood restaurant , then try La Paradeta on C / Comercial 7 about a 15 minute walk from the hotel .
Superb seafood , served refectory style .
Choose from glistening mounds of clams , mussels , squid , spider crabs and whatever else the boats have brought in , let them know how you 'd like it cooked ( grilled , steamed or a la marinera ) , pick a sauce , buy a drink and wait for your number to be called .
I would recommend Hotel 1898 as a great place to stay , especially for the wonderful rooftop terrace and the central location but do n't ask the staff for tips or advice and make sure they do n't put you into one of the small and dark corner rooms on the inner courtyard .
Oh , and watch out for the 2 elderly gentlemen standing by reception - I have no idea what their role was as they never spoke , never assisted with anything , never did anything in fact , but they were always there - management perhaps , but what they were managing I do not know ?
Awesome hotel .
Extremely nice hotel .
Rooms are very spacious and well appointed .
The room service was quick and prompt .
The staff was courteous .
Facilities were clean and modern .
Good location with excellent views .
Very nice pool setting .
Place is very busy and popular
A fine hotel .
Iron balcony
An excellent hotel - perfect for a Barcelona stay .
We loved everything about the Pulitzer .
We made two separate visits during our trip to Spain .
Both rooms were beautiful , the staff was helpful , all services worked according to plan , the restaurant and bar were excellent .
The rooms were ( in our opinion , but we 're from SF ) spacious , particularly the bathrooms .
An extra bonus point for geeks out there : the WiFi service actually worked - - at all times !
The location made it easy to get around Barcelona , being a 2 minute walk to the Metro , and / or providing easy cab access .
It is refreshing to see an expensive hotel actually meet or exceed all expectations .
This hotel would be our first choice if we returned to Barcelona , and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city .
WONDERFUL SURPRISE ! !
We loved the Jazz , stayed there for two nights November 10 and 11 , 2004 .
Excellent central location , great modern , functional bedroom overlooking busy street , but no street sounds when window closed .
The Jazz provided us with a great breakfast .
Checkin and checkout were troublefree , staff very helpful .
We 'd not hesitate to use the Jazz again , or to recommend it to friends .
We had learnt about the Jazz from its Trip Adviser rating .
It earned its high rating , in our minds !
Great Position .
We have just returned from a week in Barcelona with our two teenage sons .
I searched long and hard for the hotel that would allow us to be close to the centre of Barcelona , yet make the most of the coast and have a pool to return to after a hard day 's site seeing .
The first objective was well satisfied , as the hotel is within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and the Metro .
The beaches were also easily reached by taxi from the hotel costing approximately six euros .
The pool , however was a major let down .
On the hotel 's website it appears to be the size of an Olympic pool , but in reality it was nothing more than an ice cold plunge pool .
It was surrounded by a fairly large open space that should , for a five star hotel , have been filled with sun beds .
It had about sixteen with the vaste majority of guests having to sit or lay on the floor .
We arrived at the hotel in the morning and were told our rooms would be ready at 2pm .
We returned at 2 . 30 and were given the key to our son 's room , which was on the seventh floor facing an office block , not good !
After six phone calls and six times of being told that our room would be ready in ten minutes , we finally got in at 4 . 30 .
Our double room also faced an office block , but did at least have a second window to the side .
The rooms were beautifully presented and very well cared for by the cleaners , who scowled at us daily because we chose not to rise until about 10am .
To summarise - a grand building , some highly dodgy positioning of rooms and views .
A rather souless hotel whose service is not , despite the excellent concierge , that of a five star hotel .
Good - but not that good !
A good hotel , but slightly less than I would expect from a five star - in my opinion it 's a good 4 star .
Although the rooms are supposed to be cleaned twice a day , ours was done only once on one of the days - no great problem , but not the standard advertised .
The bed had to be the most uncomfortable we 'd ever slept in - rock hard .
If you want to drink bottled water , take in your own .
The mini bar charges 4 Euros for a third of a litre - sheer extortion !
Staff very helpful - good breakfast - although sometimes the waiters disappeared , and forgot what was a simple request for tea instead of coffee .
The hotel is also situated at the port , which might have explained a chill wind in early May .
Handy though for the excellent red and blue route tourist buses - must be the best value in the city .
Overall an OK short stay , but we have stopped in better hotels .
Top Class Hotel .
My Hubby and I stayed at the hotel 24 - 27th Sept for the first leg of our Honey Moon , and what a delight .
We were upgraded to a Junior Suite with Champers Chocolates .
Our room was cleaned daily with a turn down service every evening .
The location was excellent with a 5 min stroll to La Ramblas .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone , it can be pricie , but well worth it . Definately worth it 's 5 Stars .
Great Location .
My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights .
The hotel is in a great location but that is probably all I liked .
On arrival we were allocated a room that absolutely reeked of smoke even though we 'd requested non - smoking .
I was 4 months pregnant at the time and the smell made me want to be sick .
We complained and they eventually agreed to move us to another room .
The room did n't smell of smoke , was more spacious so we were really pleased !
Until it got to 4am the next morning and we could hear two guys in the room next to us using the toilet , talking etc etc !
It was awful !
Perhaps we were just unlucky and got the rubbish rooms but I would not stay here again !
Terrible Staff - Not Five Stars .
Quite simply one of the worst hotels we have ever , ever stayed in !
The pool is non existent .
Do n't go there for a pool or any outdoor space .
We stayed in a Deluxe Room for a week long vacation on the second floor with a view of a concrete wall !
On our first morning we were woken up by staff shouting singing and banging as they were setting up for a party that night .
This was at six thirty am on our holiday in a supposedly five star hotel .
When we complained the manager said there was nothing they could do .
We asked if the party was going to go on late and keep us awake that night and he responded by saying he did not know .
So we went out that night and returned at one am assuming that the party would be finished or at least quiet by then this was not the case with a band playing right beneath our window all night until three am !
When my girlfriend called reception and the duty manager to ask for us to be moved the manager hung up the phone on her !
That has never ever happened in my life !
You may think this is just a one off bad experience but it was n't there were several other instances of not just bad but appalling service even by three star standards .
We went to the concierge one day and asked for a dinner reservation he insisted that we take a taxi to this beautiful romantic restaurant he knew of we asked if it was close he said yes five minutes .
Forty five minutes later and 40 Euros worse off we were dropped off at a Cafe with plastic tables and a load of Dutch tourists from a cruise ship !
Not what we expected when we asked for a high class romantic restaurant in Barcelona !
Do n't stay at this hotel there are so many better hotels with better facilities and location and most of all staff with brains and some decent training .
Even the three and four star hotels would be better than this place .
Its a hotel for business guests only or cruise ship guests for one night .
Other than that stay away !
Waste of money !
We are , in fact STILL here .
We can not wait to check out !
Here 's the scoop .
The hotel itself is clean , modern and the rooms are spacious .
That 's as good as it gets .
I booked my reservations through a travel agent in Scottsdale , Arizona and well , I should have done it myself because it would have been about the tenth of the cost and maybe it would n't suck so much . . . .
Fisrt of all , if you speak English , they have people who speak it rather well .
HOWEVER - - the people who work here do not like Brits , Americans , etc and will automatically give you the crappiest room available .
Our room ( along with any other English speaking patron ) gets the WORST view amaginable .
OVER THE CONSTRUCTION DUMP !
We are on the tenth floor and have n't slept a wink .
The walls are paper thin , the windows might as well be open - - it 's THAT loud .
There are teenage skaters all over the front of the hotel and they are dirty and they WILL steal your wallet !
The person next to us had his taken out of his pocket !
This hotel is SO far away from everything - - unless you have business to do right around here , you ar wasting your money staying here .
You will spend the majority of your time on the train .
Forget staying out late becuase the trains do n't run past midnight - - however , everything starts after midnight !
The area the hotel is in is dirty , and very poor area of town .
There is NOTHING to do hee and it wil take FOREVER to get to where you want to go .
If I could give you one piece of advice - - either pay more for a hotel closer to where you will actually be doing things , or come back at another time .
Staying in this part of town is an absolute complete waste of money .
What a sad excuse for a hotel . . .
This place is well past it .
It may have cut it a few years back when Barcelona was one of the poorer European cities , but these days it has been left behind by a crop of much better and trendier places , actually located in town !
A lump of concrete with some expensive shops does not equal a good hotel .
Maybe in Baghdad I would accept this fake and soulless place and be happy that I was safe from bombs , but in central Barcelona ( please note this hotel is nowhere near central ) , I have a choice of at least five better places .
The hotel really needs to pick its act up as younger rich people are looking for more than over priced drinks , non - speaking Catalan staff and signage ( Barcelona is the capital of Catalunya ) , and general drabness of this god awful place .
The last time I went there I hoped I would never be unfortunate enough to return .
I will remember this more clearly next time .
Lastly , working girls may keep the ( current roster of ) business types happy , but the market has moved on , and it would be highly suggested to get out and look at some leading places such as : Malmaison , Hotel du Vin and Sofitel , which yes do charge your sort of high prices , but do deliver an exceptional service , not some drab pastiche of international travel that is no longer acceptable in 2006 .
I can only conclude that anyone who actually ' likes ' this place has very little idea of what a leading venue should have to offer .
Good option in Barcelona .
This is a good hotel option in Barcelona .
Property generally : Overall , while the design elements are very well carried out , this does feel primarily like a business hotel , and offers no particular Spanish , Catalanian , or even particularly European character per se .
It is , however , very modern and has comfortable , clean , fashionable public spaces .
Rooms : Well sized , good amenities , well kept , clean and very stylish .
Good for either a holiday or a business trip .
The windows are well insulated , so even overlooking the busy street , the rooms remain quiet , though hallway noise does come through the door .
Location : Excellent .
The property is an easy walk to Passeig de Gracia , La Ramblas , and even the beach is not a difficult hike .
Oddly , there was no city map provided in the hotel , though I did n't ask the concierge who I assume would have had one available .
Service : Every staff member I came into contact with was helpful and generally friendly , and were able to speak with me in English and French .
The only warning to people generally about Barcelona is that the shopping is incredibly good - perhaps amongst the best shopping cities in the world - so beware the smoking credit card !
Unwilling Management .
We spent a nice time in barcelona .
My husband , my two taughters ( 12 and 14 years ) and our little son ( baby ) .
The hotel is nice but there is a lot of traffic noice also during the night .
So you must keep the windows closed .
The hotel bar is realy bad - sorry for that .
The hotel offers a good continental breakfast . .
If you make an online reservation , it is impossible to mention that you travel with children .
So an adults room price will be charged for them , if they stay in a seperat room .
Neither the hotel staff nor the manager was willed to change the fee to a children rate , only the baby is free of charge .
That is realy a shame for a hotel with four stars .
That 's the way a satisfied guest leaves the hotel angry and dissatisfied .
Nice , new hotel .
We stayed in Barcelona for three days during our European honeymoon .
The hotel is very new and is quite nice and the staff is well informed and friendly .
There are advantages to staying in a new hotel as it does not exhibit the kind of wear and tear that is quite common in numerous luxury European hotels .
The hotel upgraded us to a nice corner room and had a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolate covered strawberries in our room . A nice touch , which we appreciated .
The only bummer , which to my surprise , was not noted in any previous reviews , is that the hotel is somewhat isolated .
It is a 10 - 15 minute walk to any restaurants and shops .
Not a huge distance , but there are many other hotel options that are located right in the thick of things , which is my preference .
Plus , sometimes you just want to walk out to get a quick snack or buy a newspaper and hotels in Europe generally do not have gift shops .
I would consider staying here again , and would recommend it if you do n't mind the location , but would probably stay closer to all the action next time .
Marie celeste hotel !
Quite easy not to talk to a soul here .
It 's cold , clinical , joyless .
Expect no warmth at all .
Effectively its a posh office block . . .
But great views and a delightful breakfast .
The parking is exorbitant , but drivers dont really have a choice .
Be aware , my money were stolen in Pulitzer .
I stayed in Pulitzer 3rd - 6th June 2008 .
I checked in the hotel 2 . 00pm and I was desparetely hungry .
I just quickly throw my luggage in the room , took some money from the wallet and went out for a lunch .
In a hurry I just left my wallet in cupboard , not in safety box ( my mistake ! ) .
There was 250€ when I left the wallet in my room , but when I returned 1 hour later there was only 150€ So 100€ was missing .
I informed lady in the front desk about the incident and she promised to investigate it .
Next day I talked with the Front Desk Manager and she gave me the printouts , which showed who had visited my room in previous day .
There was a fact that 2 cleaning ladies had visited my room when I had been having a lunch , but they denied taking the money .
So there was a proof that 2 cleaning ladies had visited my room , 100€ was gone .
My word against them .
The answer from the hotel was that as I had not put my money in the safety box , they are not responsible of them .
I never got my money back and I did n't even get the apology from hotel .
If you want go this hotel , do n't leave your money out of your sight !
Good Location , Great Service .
We booked this hotel for a conference trip after reading reviews on TripAdvisor .
The reviews were accurate - the hotel staff were the best I have encountered in a long time . They were helpful at all times , were able to recommend restaurants and bars to suit us and our plans , gave accurate directions , lent us an iron and ironing board , and kept the rooms and common areas very clean .
The location of the hotel is excellent - it is a short walk to Las Ramblas and the Barri Gotic , a moderate walk to the shopping in L ' Eixample , a department store / supermarket ( El Corte Ingles ) is within 3 minutes , and the metro line to the CCIB conference centre runs from Passeig de Gracia station , about 5 minutes walk away .
As we were there on business , computer facilities were important .
Wireless internet is free in this hotel .
We were able to use the printers in the Hotel Regina next door .
The room was long and narrow compared to other hotels , but there was enough space .
The desk is only a fold down door on the cabinet in the room corner .
There is a room safe .
Many of the rooms open onto the atrium that stands above the lobby bar . This was noisy on the weekend night only , until about midnight .
The front door of the room did not block out noise of the cleaning staff or neighbour 's doors opening , but we have had similar ( and worse ) problems in other hotels in Barcelona .
Breakfast cost 15 euros .
I ate at one of many cheaper cafes nearby .
Perfect - really should be a 5* rather than a 4* .
Myself and my partner have just returned from Hotel 1898 for a 3 night stay from the 9th to the 12th of February .
I 've never actually written a review before however Tripadvisor was very helpful to me when choosing the hotel for a very special surprise weekend with my partner so I 've decided to put our views in writing - so here goes !
From the outset there was somebody to help with the bags and the staff were very professional , polite and helpful taking us up to the room and even showing us how to use the lights ( a very cool and modern dimmer system ) and the bathrooms ( all Ghroe fittings with a fantastic rainfall shower ) .
The decor was perfect , rooms had plenty of room and nice and quiet ( no noise from the hallway hardwood floors as suggested by some - all carpeted ) .
Our room had a brand new 32 LCD TV mounted on the was which was very nice and the aircon was spot on .
Breakfast was amazing ( I echo what another reviewer said though - get it included in the price or its 拢18 euro a day each ) .
The pool and sauna faclilities were very nice and very quiet also .
We spent a fair bit of time at the hotel bar after an evening out chating to Carlos the happy little barman ( he makes great and very potent - Sangria which we recomend ! )
Location - halfway down La Ramblas ( directly opposite the Meridian ) was perfect .
Somebody made a comment about doubting people who wrote these reviews had ever stayed in a 5* hotel .
Well I 've stayed at the Conrad in Chelsea Harbour , Capodimonte in Sorrento and the Four Seasons in Montreal and I would honestly say that this hotel is up there with them .
When we return to Barcelona we will certainly stay at this establishment again .
Nice but small .
Good location , nice decor but very small room and restaurant closed on Sunday .
Excellent Hotel in the heart of the city .
This hotel could easily be 5 star , the facilities are fantastic , the rooms beautifully furnished and equipped with all the latest technology .
The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in .
Take the continental breakfast in your room , it was really good value for money and there was a good choice .
We used the spa and indoor pool in the evenings which again was excellent .
The lounge and bar areas were relaxing and comfortable , and perfect for a night - cap in the evening .
Our only let down was the restaurant , onour first night we had dinner and the food was very poor and the dining room was cold and did not have the same atmosphere as the rest of this beautiful hotel .
Over all we would highly reccomend Hotel1898 and would deffinately make a return visit .
A good hotel located at the centre of the action .
The 1898 is a good , modern , efficient hotel located at the top of La Rambla .
It seems to have been recently refurbished , and to a high standard .
The rooms are dark wood in decor and have an excellent lighting and air - con system .
The spa downstairs is adequate .
The pool is small but comfortable , ditto the gym .
One let - down is the bar area , which is long and narrow and a bit soulless , but as you 've got literally hundreds of fantastic bars on your doorstep in Barca it 's not a problem .
Even though it 's located in the heart of La Rambla , the interior rooms are extremely quiet , so sleeping is not a problem .
I took my 75 - year old mum to the hotel and she slept no problem at all .
Where did the 4 stars come from ?
In a nutshell , clean and acceptable hotel , great location .
No idea how they got their 4 stars , they have a lift , but no swimming pool , no sauna / steam room , the rooms are small , no tea or coffee facilities .
Unfortunately , I booked this hotel with HOTELCLUB and they booked me a double room even though I stated that I had a 9 year old child .
Anyway , I had to pay another 50 euros and HOTELCLUB does n't want to know .
If I knew about the additional charge , I think I would be rented an apartment instead since you would have more room and you can buy glorious fresh produce from the market and not pay for city priced meals at or around the hotel .
great location !
Good hotel in a super location !
Friendly reception which was very helpful and they also suggested a great restaurant .
Comfortable rooms , although located on the Ramblas little to no noice from the street .
Lessons in customer service !
DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL .
I have travelled extensively in recent years and have had many enjoyable weekend breaks at various priced hotels .
As a special treat me and 18 of my friends decided to do something a bit special and stay at the Grand Marina .
It was the worst experience of my life .
The service received from the staff was nothing short of offensive , the manager was the rudest person I have ever met in my life .
I personally will never be returning to the Grand Marina and I will make it my lifes mission to makesure nobody else does either ! ! !
Beware - this hotel overbooks - you may not get your room !
We made our booking for 2 rooms for 4 elderly pensioners ( one 83 years old ) arriving in the middle of the night through HotelTravel . com .
It was CONFIRMED in May for 2 nights in September and FULLY PAID by credit card .
Imagine our horror to arrive at 3 . 00am ( having notified our late arrival at the time of booking ) to find NO ROOMS available .
The hotel staff did n't seem at all concerned saying they overbook all the time .
They said as there was an exhibition on we would be lucky to get 2 rooms together but would try .
At first they tried to seperate our party of 4 and put us in a hotel just for one night .
Only after we made a fuss did we manage to get a hotel for the 2 nights together .
To add insult to injury a Spanish customer arrived after us and checked in normally and given a room !
We did n't get to our rooms at the other hotel until 6 . 00 am and we were on the opposite side of Barcelona away from other members of our group .
We spent most of the next day in bed recovering from the ordeal and the 2 day break was ruined .
HotelTravel . com has told us the hotel refuses to take any action or responsibilty and they can only offer credit points of 40 euros off our next booking with them .
We are disgusted with both HotelTravel . com the Torre Catalunya Hotel .
Bad service .
It is the worst service i have seen in a five star hotel .
they could not read our visa in the club level so we have to pay cash .
after that due to unexpected maintenance work we stayed without water a whole saturday !
can you imagine - without water in ritz carlton property !
Underwhelming .
Stayed at the hotel Royal in Feb .
The location is fine but the hotel is just ok .
The staff were civil but not at all helpful .
The halls and lobby are very dark and while the hotel is very clean it has a dreary quality about it .
Lots of british soccer fans were staying there when I was there ( Chelsea vs Barca ) which was fun , but I would not stay there again .
Just okay .
I vacationed in Barcelona for 4 days and stayed at the Gran Torre Catalunya .
Most of the reviews are fairly accurate .
The hotel is close to a metro , clean , friendly staff , etc .
However , please keep in mind the hotel is not unique and has no character whatsoever .
The walls are very thin and inside the room can be very noisy .
Most of the disturbance is caused by the cleaning staff which makes it difficult to sleep in .
The hotel is also close to one of the major train stations so there is also a lot of traffic noise , sirens , etc . which one can hear from the room 22 stories high .
Price makes this hotel attractive and one of the main reasons it 's ranked so high on tripadvisor .
However , I think you can do better as far as location .
I would recommend staying in Barri Gothic region of the City .
Front desk is very knowledgeable and gives great suggestions on tapas bars , siteseeing and shopping .
I strongly would suggest staying this hotel as a 2nd choice .
Very nice hotel , decent location .
My husband and I stayed at the Barcelona Universal Hotel for 3 nights in July .
We thought the hotel is great overall . .
VERY nice rooms , very spacious ( which is pretty surprising , since its Europe ) .
Bathroom was clean .
The location was ok , there 's a metro station right outside the hotel which proved to be very convenient .
The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to La Rambla , but the side roads which you have to take are a little dirty , smelly , and dodgy . . so we took the metro instead .
It 's just 2 stops away , and the Catalunya Plaza is also on the same metro line .
This area has lots of restaurants and shops .
Information center was also here ( La Rambla ) .
The people at the front desk were not very friendly . . but we noticed this throughout our trip in Spain .
We reached the hotel early ( around 1030 ) but were asked to wait until 330 for a room .
They let us leave our luggage at the hotel though , until our room was ready .
They have a basic gym and a pool , though the pool is extremely small .
Free internet facility too , which is normally not occupied .
Breakfast was included in our package , and we thought it was pretty good .
The hotel is good overall , and we would definitely recommend it !
Hotel 1898 .
My DH and I stayed here for 3 nights pre cruise 04 / 30 / 07 - 05 / 03 / 07 .
We booked this hotel based on trip ad visor reviews .
It is a really good hotel but not the best I have ever stayed at .
We booked a superior room which was lovely , but very small with only one window looking out into the back court yard .
The bathroom was really beautiful with a really cool shower and enormous bath towels .
Very hard mattress but was so tired from walking all over Barcelona was able to sleep well .
We did not eat the breakfast for 18 euros .
Many places to eat around hotel .
Ate at the Attic restaurant right across the street , need a reservation for sure .
Next year when I return to BCN I will probably try another hotel there are many to choose from .
Great hotel .
We stayed at the Clarion for 1 night in May and it was great !
The rooms are very small , but nicely decorated with modern furnishings .
The staff was very nice and helpful .
You can not beat the location !
The hotel is located right around the corner from Las Ramblas .
Wish we could have stayed longer but our cruise left the next day !
Highly recommended !
Great location , rooms and staff but avoid the breakfast .
We have recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Universal .
The hotel is great , nice large rooms that are well serviced .
The staff were incredibly helpful and spoke excellent English .
The Universal is 5 mins from Las Ramblas . . . and perfect for the Metro .
I 'll definitely stay there again .
Now for the bad news .
We had the breakfast on our second day .
The food was good but I was shocked to see staff members chasing customers down the corridor because they had left the breakfast room with an apple !
I think it is fair enough that you are n't allowed to make a packed lunch courtesy of the breakfast buffet but they were n't even allowing a dry roll to leave the room .
Take the advice of having breakfast at the hotel to the left . . . much better , a quarter of the price and a nice atmosphere .
One last point .
One of our friends uses a wheelchair and so had a specially equipped room .
These rooms are all internal . . . no choice about that , also they only have twin beds ( not much use for couples ) .
Make sure you are on a higher floor as the lower floors get a lot of kitchen noise and my friends had to move floors to get some sleep .
Great location ; Disappointing service .
We booked this hotel for 4 nights prior to a cruise based on Trip Advisor recommendations .
We had high hopes , given that it seems to be rated at least a 4 - star hotel .
I do n't have comparisons , as I have never stayed in Barcelona before , but I would rate this hotel as no better than a Hilton in the U . S .
The staff were helpful on restaurant recommendations , but otherwise indifferent .
Our room was adequate / small and would have been quiet ( even though facing the main street ) except for a party with children in the next room who stayed up until 2:00 am every night screaming .
I finally had to personally ask them to pipe the kids down .
The hotel could not change our room as it was August and at full capacity .
The hotel was also under renovation at the time we stayed , and the reception lobby was temporarily located at a side entrance . It was small and cramped .
The baggage handling staff was insufficient .
We waited 30 minutes for baggage assistance upon check - out , then hauled our luggage down ourselves .
The rooftop lounge is lovely , but they charged $ 8 for a small soda - I did n't even consider ordering a mixed drink ; as I recall they were in the $ 15 range .
The only advantage I could see to this hotel is its ' fabulous location - right in the midst of several Gaudi buildings , in walking distance to everything , and in the high end shopping area , which is much quieter than the mobbed La Ramblas touristy area .
We paid $ 269 / night by booking on the hotel web site ( 3 nights , with the 4th one free ) .
All in all , a disappointment because of the noise , cost of the rooftop drinks , and indifferent service .
Amazing Escape .
When we first arrived , we were not that excited .
Had to carry our bags across Las Rambas ( a zoo ) and came in the door off Las Ramblas . . . . not greating .
And checked into the room - seems small .
HOWEVER , as we stayed , and explored and got to know the staff , and the restaurant and the business center and the QUALITY of all of the amenities and service , it became one of my most favorite hotels in the world .
I think because it is just off Las Ramblas , the lobby is even more inviteing - a peaceful retreat from the crazy street .
Was absolutly worth every penny .
Best service ever .
I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Ritz Carlton Barcelona .
The hotel is just magnificent and the service is impeccable .
Since the moment we checked in we were treated as if we were celebrities !
Doorman Jose Ramon welcomed us with a smile and kindly showed us the way to the lobby on the first floor .
We were given an amazing corner room by Renata from front desk who also took her time to escort us to our suite on the 19th floor .
Bellman Oriol brought the luggage to our room and told us everything we needed to know about the hotel facilities .
Marta and Carlos from concierge were also very helpful and made reservations for botafumero ( fantastic shellfish at a price ) tenorio ( trendy restaurant near ramblas ) cangrejo loco ( very casual but great paela ) .
The tea saloon is beautiful and waitress Latiffa so friendly and attentive .
The spa on the 43rd floor is out of this world and the views are just breathtaking .
I have been to many luxury hotels and after my stay at this Ritz Carlton I can assure this is the best service I have ever experienced in my whole life .
Congratulations to the hotel Arts for having such fine staff !
Fab Hotel .
